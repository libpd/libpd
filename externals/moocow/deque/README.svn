To build from subversion sources, do the following:

 ./svn-prepare.sh
 ./configure
 make
 make install

The './svn-prepare.sh' script requires some shared code
in the directory ../common (relative to the package root
directory).

If you make changes to any autotools files (e.g. Makefile.am,
configure.ac), you will need to re-run automake, autoconf, etc.
This can be accomplished by running the wrapper script ./autogen.sh.

The README.txt file in the distribution is auto-generated
from perl ".pod" format by the "pod2text" included in most
Perl distributions.
