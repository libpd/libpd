To build from cvs, do the following:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

NOTE:  The README.txt file in the distribution

the "pod2text" included in most perl distributions.

You might (i.e. if you see complaints about 'optgen.perl')
also need the 'Getopt::Gen' perl module, which should
be available from:
