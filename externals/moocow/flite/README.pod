README for PD external distribution 'pd-flite'

Last updated for version 0.01

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The 'pd-flite' distribution contains a single PD external ("flite"),
which provides a high-level text-to-speech interface for English based on
the 'libflite' library by Alan W Black and Kevin A. Lenzo.

Currently tested only under linux.


=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=over 4

=item * libflite >= v1.1

The 'libflite' library by Alan W Black and Keven A. Lenzo
is required to build the PD 'flite' external.
It is available from http://cmuflite.org.

You may want to apply the patch 'libflite-noaudio.patch'
which comes with this distribution to the 'libflite'
sources before compiling them (the '--with-audio=none'
configure flag did not work for me on its own).
