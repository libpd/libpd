README for weightmap

Last updated for weightmap v0.02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

weightmap is a PD external which maps incoming probability
values to integers, inspired in part by Yves Degoyon's 'probalizer' object.


=head1 INSTALLATION

Issue the following commands to the shell:

   cd weightmap-X.YY  (or wherever you extracted the distribution)
   ./configure
   make
   make install

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

PD by Miller Puckette and others.

probalizer object by Yves Degoyon.

Ideas, black magic, and other nuggets of information drawn
from code by Guenter Geiger, Larry Troxler, and iohannes m zmoelnig.

=head1 BUGS

It's a misleading name: higher input "weights" don't neccesarily
correspond to higer stored "weights".

Probably many more serious ones as well.
