=head1 KNOWN BUGS

=head2 Memory Usage

Encoding each byte of a string as its own float is shamefully
wasteful: it uses only 1 byte out of at least 3 which could be
losslessly used given ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985 floats, not to
mention the remaining byte(s) (usually 1) of the float itself
or the (usually 4) bytes used for the a_type flag.
Unfortunately, Pd trims some floating point
precision in message boxes and in float atoms, so a truly
lossless float encoding for Pd would only be possible using
2 bytes per float (wasting 1/2 the space of the float itself),
and (to me), the memory saving such an encoding would provide
is just not worth the lack of transparency and additional
workload it would involve (but contact me if you want the code
anyways).
