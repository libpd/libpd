This is a collection of pd externals. My bag of tricks.

To build:
./configure
make

To run:
add the library to the pd startup line, and specify the
path for the included abstractions (<crebdir>/abs)

To figure out how it works:
Documentation patches in doc/
See doc/reference.txt for a list of objects

Should build on linux and darwin (OSX).

Enjoy,

Tom
