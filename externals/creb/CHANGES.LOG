0.1-0.7:	the dark ages
0.8:		2003/02/18
		fixed makefiles, added window~
		(0.8.1) some bugfixes + gcc 3 compilation problems

0.9:		lots of bugfixes and new objects & abstractions

		bugfixes:
			exponential envelopes no longer have a 'hold feature' 
			(use eadsr~ or ear~ combined with a del obj to get a hold)
			fdn~ blowup fixed
			lattice~ blowup fixed
			
		new objects:
			blocknorm~: normalizes a set of blocks to rms = 1
			sbosc~: smallband pitched complex oscillator (i.e. for formant synth)
			bitsplit~: splits a signal into a binary representation
			clog~/cexp~: complex log and exp (clib functions)
			nfft~/nifft~: normalized versions of the fft~/ifft~ objects
			blosc~: minimum phase filtered bandlimited oscillators + comparator
			resofilt~: some vintage filters with all-signal input and proper interpolation
			scrollgrid1D~: chaotic scroll grid oscillator
			
		new abstractions:
			step_*: some array readers/writers (for step sequencer)
			cstate~/cstate+~: complex dynwav state read & write
			pulsor~: pulse with duty cycle for dynwav spectral filtering
			frequor~: a phasor for frequencies (fft traversal)
			dsfosc~: complex discrete summation formula oscillator
			idsfosc~: infinite series version (cheaper, but aliased)
			cosc~: complex oscillator (complex phasor)
			ucnorm~: complex unit circle normalization
			ucmod~: complex unit circle modulation
			lattice3: expand a (3d) harmonic lattice vector to a frequency ratio
			ccmap~: complex conformal map of the unit disk
			cinv~: complex inverse
			cmul~: complex multipy
			cadd~/csub~: complex add/sub
			cconj~: complex conjugate
			fmop~: fm operator
			cep~/icep~: cepstrum transform and inverse
			sin~: sine
