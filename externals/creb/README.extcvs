NOTE FOR THE PURE DATA EXTERNALS CVS

if you need to change anything to the source files here, let me know at <tom@zwizwa.be>
to prevent i overwrite your changes when i update the CVS from my darcs archive at:

	http://zwizwa.be/darcs/creb

i update like this:

 * update from darcs tree
 * update from sourceforge cvs
 * briefly look over changes, take mine as master
 * commit darcs + sourceforge
