#X text 135 3 - search for a best match to an incoming list;
#X text 19 243 The choice object holds a list of vectors \, each having
up to ten elements. When sent a list of numbers \, it outputs the index
of the known vector that matches most closely. The quality of the match
is the dot product of the two vectors after normalizing them \, i.e.
\, the vector whose direction is closest to that of the input wins.

#X text 19 340 If given a nonzero creation argument \, choice tries
to avoid repetitious outputs by weighting less recently output vectors
preferentially.;
#X text 20 389 You can use this to choose interactively between a number
of behaviors depending on their attributes. For example \, you might
have stored a number of melodies \, of which some are syncopated \,
some chromatic \, some are more than 100 years old \, some are bugle
calls \, and some are Christmas carols. You could then ask to find
a syncopated bugle call (1 \, 0 \, 0 \, 1 \, 0) and you'll get the
thing most closely matching the request.;
#X text 19 514 You can use numbers other than 0 and 1 to indicate relative
strengths of the attributes \, or even use negative numbers to indicate
opposites \, either in the incoming lists or in the stored ones.;
