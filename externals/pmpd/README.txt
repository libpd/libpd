pmpd is a collection of objects for pd.  These objects provide real-time  simulations, specially 
physical behaviors. pmpd can be used to create natural dynamic systems, like a bouncing ball, 
string movement, Brownian movement, chaos,  fluid dynamics, sand, gravitation, and more. It can 
also be used to create displacements  thus allowing a completely dynamic approach of pd 
computing. 

With pmpd physical dynamics can be modelled without knowing the global equation of the 
movement. Only the cause of the movement and the involved structure are needed for the 
simulation. pmpd provides the basic objects for this kind of simulation. Assembling them allows the 
creation of a very large variety of dynamic systems . 

These object are designed to be used with pd (pd). pd is a real time graphical programming 
environment dedicated for audio signal processing. Pd allow the creation of object and it is well 
adapted of the creation of particular physical modelling. GEM is a pd library dedicated to images 
processing [14]. In the provided pmpd examples, GEM is used for the movement visualisation.
