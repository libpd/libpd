Description: physical modeling library for Pd
 A library for Pd for modeling the interactions of the physical world. These
 objects provide real-time simulations, specially physical behaviors. pmpd can
 be used to create natural dynamic systems, like a bouncing ball, string
 movement, Brownian movement, chaos, fluid dynamics, sand, gravitation, and
 more. It can also be used to create displacements thus allowing a completely
 dynamic approach of pd computing.
