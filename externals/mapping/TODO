= curves

review all curves in accordance with the paper

- [curve_table] or [curve_graph]?


______________________________________________________________________________
= spread/segment/seglet

Make [collect] and [distribute], which are like [segment] and [desegment].
Perhaps it should be called [seglet] and [deseglet]

______________________________________________________________________________
= one->many

something like [segment]? or [seglet]?

=
- check out behavior of [curve_power] and [curve_root] if non-integers are
  used as arguments on in the right inlets


- merge ds_ list objects with abstractions/footils/list-abs


- http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/pages/code-pd.html
  check out f0.smooth and f0.smooth2 (single/double exponential smoothing)


-track down Golan Levin's curve algorithm page

______________________________________________________________________________
= figure out whole degree issue

- should degree conversion also change rotation direction and 0 point?  The
  degrees on a compass rotate the opposite direction of radians.  The 0 point
  of a compass is due north, with radians, its right/due east.

- [hid_polar] should take an argument (in degrees?) which specifies where the
  0 is on the circle

= mapping object ideas

[hid2midi] [midi2hid]

midi value + bend <-> hid
	  - use MIDI pitch and bend data for values in between MIDI notes?

object for Fletcher-Munson Equal-loudness contours 

median average object

[infinitepot] for use with a [knob] or any single axis that could be infinite.

[hid_debounce]

peak finder object

"kalman filters"
