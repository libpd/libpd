this Gem.dll is the Gem-binary for w32

it is optimized for Pentium-Pro, so it should run on quite every machine

this file has been compiled and tested on winXP
it probably can be used on w2k too, but chances are low that you can run it on older versions of w32.

you might have to install a recent version of DirectX (>9.0)
if you want to play-back QuickTime-videos, you have to install QuickTime first (current version is 7.2)



this is an alpha-release: please test it an report back any bugs you encounter
