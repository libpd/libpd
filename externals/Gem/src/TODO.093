General Rendering Issues
: alpha in gemwindow?

Missing help-patches

Untested objects
: vertex_* ?


intial arguments:
	pix_threshold
	pix_crop: arguments/inlets differ!



Object specific bugs
: pix_freeframe not supported on x86_64 architectures (needs discussion on the freeframe list: people there are a bit reluctant to change the specs (like enforcing 32bit pointers)
: incorporate new libparticle API
: make [gemhead] an abstraction
: make [gemwin] an abstraction
. [gemwindow] object: [gemXwindow] [gemCocoaWindow] [gemw32indow]
: upside-down orientation of images:  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/443086/opengl-topdown-bottomup-textures


OS specific bugs
linux:
: sometimes window freezes on "destroy"; (JMZ: i experience this sometimes on improper shutdown, but after some (up to 30) seconds, the window finally gets destroyed and pd exits fine; if this is the same as the reported bug, than it is rather an inconvenience than a real bug)
: resizing the window yields weird results



osx:
: pix_movie flickers
: carbon not supported anymore on 10.6

w32:
: [pix_share_*] does not exist since the shared-memory concept has not made it to redmond yet
: crashes when texturing movies (related to GLEW?)
