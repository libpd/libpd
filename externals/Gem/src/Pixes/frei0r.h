/** @mainpage frei0r - a minimalistic plugin API for video effects
 *
 * @section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * This is frei0r - a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.
 *
 * The main emphasis is on simplicity - there are many different applications
 * that use video effects, and they all have different requirements regarding
 * their internal plugin API. And that's why frei0r does not try to be a
 * one-in-all general video plugin API, but instead an API for the most
 * common video effects: simple filters, sources and mixers that can be
 * controlled by parameters.
 *
 * It's our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared between
 * many applications, avoiding their reimplementation by different
 * projects.
 *
 * On the other hand, this is not meant as a competing standard to
 * more ambitious efforts that try to satisfy the needs of many different
 * applications and more complex effects.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_overview Overview
 *
 * If you are new to frei0r, the best thing is probably to have
 * a look at the <a href="frei0r_8h-source.html">frei0r header</a>,
 * which is quite simple.
 *
 * After that, you might want to look at the 
 * <a href="frei0r_8h.html">frei0r functions</a> in more detail.
 *
 * When developing a new frei0r effect, you have to choose
 *  - which effect type to use (\ref PLUGIN_TYPE),
 *  - which color model to use (\ref COLOR_MODEL), and
 *  - which parameter types (\ref PARAM_TYPE) your effect will support.
 *
 * To round things up, you should decide whether your effect should have
 * an associated icon (\ref icons), and where it will be installed
 * (\ref pluglocations).
 *
 * @section sec_changes Changes
 *
 * @subsection sec_changes_1_0_1_1 From frei0r 1.0 to frei0r 1.1
 *
 *   - added specifications for plugin locations
 *   - added specifications for frei0r icons
 *   - added RGBA8888 color model
 *   - added packed32 color model
 *   - added better specification of color models
 *   - added string type
 *   - added bounds to resolution (8 <= width, height <= 2048)
 *   - width and height must be an integer multiple of 8
 *   - frame data must be 16 byte aligned
 *   - improved update specification (must not change parameters,
 *      must restore fpu state)
 *   - added note for applications to ignore effects with unknown fields
 *   - added new plugin types mixer2 and mixer3
 *   - added section about \ref concurrency

/**
 * \addtogroup pluglocations Plugin Locations
 * @section sec_pluglocations Plugin Locations
 *
 * For Unix platforms there are rules for the location of frei0r plugins.
 *
 * frei0r 1.x plugin files should be located in
 *
 * - (1) /usr/lib/frei0r-1/\<vendor\>
 * - (2) /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/\<vendor\>
 * - (3) $HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/\<vendor\>
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * - /usr/lib/frei0r-1/mob/flippo.so
 * - /usr/lib/frei0r-1/drone/flippo.so
 * - /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/gephex/coma/invert0r.so
 * - /home/martin/.frei0r-1/lib/martin/test.so
 *
 * Like in these examples plugins should be placed in "vendor" subdirs
 * to reduce name clashes.
 *
 * @subsection sec_order Plugin Loading Order
 *
 * The application shall load plugins in the following order: 3, 2, 1.
 * If a name clash occurs (two or more frei0r plugins with identical
 * effect name), the plugins in directory 3 have precedence over plugins
 * in directory 2, and those in directory 2 have precedence over plugins
 * in directory 1.
 *
 * This makes it possible for users to "override" effects that are
 * installed in system wide directories by placing plugins in their
 * home directory.
 *
 * The order of loading plugins inside each of the directories 
 * 1, 2, and 3 is not defined.
 */

/**
 *\addtogroup icons Icons for frei0r effects
 * @section sec_icons Icons for frei0r effects
 *
 * Each frei0r effect can have an associated icon.
 *
 * @subsection sec_icon_format Icon Format
 *
 * The format of frei0r icons must be png.
 * Recommended resolution is 64x64.
 * The icon filename of an effect with effect name "frei0r"
 * must be "frei0r.png".
 *
 * @subsection sec_icon_location Icon location
 *
 * The exact location where the application should look for the
 * plugin is platform dependant.
 *
 * For Windows platforms, the icon should be at the same place as
 * the plugin containing the effect.
 *
 * For Unix platforms, the following mapping from plugin location
 * to icon location must be used:
 *
 * Let \<plugin_path\>/\<plugin\> be a frei0r plugin with name \<effect_name\>.
 * Then the corresponding icon (if any) shall be located in
 * \<icon_path\>/\<effect_name\>.png.
 * \<icon_path\> can be obtained in the following way:
 *
 * @verbatim
  <plugin_path>                   |     <icon_path>                   
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 $HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/<vendor>     | $HOME/.frei0r-1/icons/<vendor>    
 /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/<vendor> | /usr/local/share/frei0r-1/icons/<vendor>
 /usr/lib/frei0r-1/<vendor>       | /usr/share/frei0r-1/icons/<vendor>
          *                       | <plugin_path>
 @endverbatim
 *
 * (The wildcard '*' stands for any other plugin_path)
 *
 * For other platforms, no location is defined. We recommend to use the
 * plugin path where possible.

/** \addtogroup COLOR_MODEL Color Models
 * List of supported color models.
 *
 * Note: the color models are endian independent, because the
 * color components are defined by their positon in memory, not
 * by their significance in an uint32_t value.
 * 
 * For effects that work on the color components,
 * RGBA8888 is the recommended color model for frei0r-1.1 effects.
 * For effects that only work on pixels, PACKED32 is the recommended
 * color model since it helps the application to avoid unnecessary
 * color conversions.
 *
 * Effects can choose an appropriate color model, applications must support
 * all color models and do conversions if necessary. Source effects
 * must not use the PACKED32 color model because the application must know
 * in which color model the created framebuffers are represented.
 *
 * For each color model, a frame consists of width*height pixels which
 * are stored row-wise and consecutively in memory. The size of a pixel is
 * 4 bytes. There is no extra pitch parameter
 * (i.e. the pitch is simply width*4).
 *
 * The following additional constraints must be honored:
 *   - The top-most line of a frame is stored first in memory.
 *   - A frame must be aligned to a 16 byte border in memory.
 *   - The width and height of a frame must be positive
 *   - The width and height of a frame must be integer multiples of 8
 *
 * These constraints make sure that each line is stored at an address aligned
 * to 16 byte.
