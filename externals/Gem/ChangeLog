	  basically telling you it's all your fault

2011-07-22 08:43  zmoelnig

	* turn off warnings in M$VC
	  
	  we are deriving an exported class from a non-exportet class,
	  which gives a warning!

	  parent-class is from the STL (but why do they warn then...)

	  now that all the image-loading components is in plugins, it
	  should be possible
	  to re-enable all available backends.
	  - i tried to load both plugins and couldn't trigger the crash
	  anymore
	  - the crash might be releated to libstdc++ more than to the use
	  of ImageMagick
	  AND libTIFF (which should be no problem with plugins, since the
	  plugins are
	  both loaded well after stdc++ is (loaded and) initialized by Gem
	  - if loading both plugins still makes trouble, the user can
	  disable a certain
	  backend by "not installing" (or removing it)
	  - if package management software is used, the conflicting plugins
	  could be
	  disallowed to install in parallel.

	* use "--with-video=plugins" if you want to use plugins

2011-03-22 08:07  zmoelnig

	  should fix compilation issues on osx/10.5

2011-03-21 21:24  eighthave

	* endianess issues of pixes
	  
	  
	  on big-endian architectures that are not OSX, we
	  need to specially care for the reverse images.
	  
	  btw, images will still be wrong when doing X-forwarding
	  between BE and LE machines

2011-03-04 19:05  zmoelnig

	* version of pix_tIIR that uses float internally

2011-02-27 15:40  zmoelnig

	* use shared GemContext's for gemglxwindow

2011-02-25 11:22  zmoelnig

2011-02-23 13:37  zmoelnig

	* make [gemhead] a child of [gemreceive]
	  
	  [gemhead] now listens to the global "__gem_render" (and
	  "__gem_render_osd")
	  receivers in an ordered fashion ([gemreceive] logic).
	  thus GemMan need no longer maintain it's own renderChain lists
	  and instead can
	  simply send a symbol...

2011-02-23 13:24  zmoelnig

	* fix gemreceive so classes can properly inherit from it

	* allow to change the title on the fly

2011-02-22 13:46  zmoelnig

	* no need to register default messages; allow window to be moved
	  programmatically (though the size is wrong after that...)

2011-02-22 13:45  zmoelnig

	* GemContext now handles the default messages on it's own (override
	  virtual if you want a different behaviour)

2011-02-22 11:26  zmoelnig

	* pimpled w32 window to allow easier creation of sharedContext

	  support this
	  LATER: add support (and checks) for other float formats

2011-02-18 18:36  zmoelnig

	* fix configure.ac

2011-01-22 16:20  zmoelnig

	* tried to stabilize things (no luck)
	  
	  sometimes you have to set the device-name and/or(?) the
	  resolution of the device
	  before starting the transfer (e.g. turning rendering on), else it
	  will simply fail
	  i believe this is a bug in (my old version of) unicap.
	  e.g. my PS3-eye which definitely only supports 640x480,
	  enumerates a single
	  format (good) of 768x576 (oops!)

	* renamed from Lock to Mutex

2011-01-21 16:56  zmoelnig

	  deferring it to the init() phase

2011-01-05 20:44  zmoelnig

	* remember name of successfully opened codec

2011-01-05 20:43  zmoelnig

	* putFrame() now returns bool rather than int

2011-01-05 20:36  zmoelnig

	* separate internal from external gem::record API
	  
	  gem::record implementations implement open(), close() &
	  putFrame()

	  to the info-out

2010-10-30 11:59  zmoelnig

	  also enumerate available devices (either of the active backend or
	  of all
	  backends) and allow the user to open this without the complicated
	  videoHALCON
	  syntax (e.g. if enumeration reports
	  "0030530f8e64_Basler_scA640120gm" for the
	  "GigEVision" backend, then using a device
	  "0030530f8e64_Basler_scA640120gm" will
	  automatically use the correct backend

2010-10-26 19:57  nusmuk

	* better help file for pix_data

2010-10-25 11:05  zmoelnig

	  call G_FMT to initialize the v4l2_format structure (else some
	  drivers would try
	  to set the dimension of the capture image to "0,0" and returning
	  some minimal
	  framesize...)
	  
	  also avoid calling S_FMT if everything is as we expect it
	  anyhow...

2010-10-25 08:15  zmoelnig

	* make sure QUERYCTRL is called with the correct id
	  
	  some drivers modify the queryctrl.id, making the for-loop
	  virtually
	  return NEVER;
	  therefore we use a separate loop-parameter

2010-10-25 08:12  zmoelnig

	* debugging output
	  
	  this time we can separately set debugging-printout for xioctl,
	  threads and
	  normal

2010-10-24 20:13  zmoelnig

	* debugging output

2010-10-24 17:32  zmoelnig

	* properly shut down transfer in stopTransfer
	  
	  it seems like we have to cleanup the REQBUFS ioctl as well, by
	  calling
	  it and requesting "0" buffers.
	  at least this shuts down the streaming in such a way that we can
	  change the
	  format of the captured image (eg. dimension)

2010-10-24 17:32  zmoelnig

	* added comment on why we have to use G_FMT
	  
	  while S_FMT is supposed to update the fields of the format struct
	  to the
	  actually valid values, it seems to not do so (at least the
	  "uvcvideo" driver).
	  thus we have to manually call G_FMT

2010-10-24 17:31  zmoelnig

	* removed dimension-setting from startTransfer
	  
	  width/height settings should really only be applied in
	  setProperties

2010-10-24 17:30  zmoelnig

	* use xioctl rather than v4l2_ioctl
	  
	  xioctl is a wrapper for v4l2_ioctl

2010-10-24 17:30  zmoelnig

	* debugging printout
	  
	  added new define debugIOCTL for debugging v4l2_ioctlS.
	  fixed typos in debugging output.
	  removed unconditional debugging output

2010-10-24 17:29  zmoelnig

	* don't set the channel in startTransfer
	  
	  this is done in setProperties() if needed

2010-10-24 17:29  zmoelnig

	* removed "buggy driver paranoia", as it doesn't do anything
	  meaningful
	  
	  all the code sets variables that are never ever used again

2010-10-24 17:28  zmoelnig

	* moved and disabled the cropping code
	  
	  the old code tried to reset all cropping; moved this into
	  setProperties() and
	  disabled it for now (as i would like the interface to change as
	  little as
	  possible without the user explicitely requesting it)

2010-10-24 17:27  zmoelnig

	* implemented and updated to new interface of plugin/video.h
	  
	  mostly setting of properties works now (at least for PARAMs)

2010-10-24 17:27  zmoelnig

	* better debugging output
	  
	  either more readable code or more information or both

2010-10-24 17:26  zmoelnig

	* updated properties interface and Pd-interface
	  
	  properties interface is more flexible;
	  Pd interface allows to get data into patch

2010-10-22 19:03  zmoelnig

	* starting to port to new interface

2010-10-22 14:49  zmoelnig

	* get/set/enumerate properties

2010-10-22 14:47  zmoelnig

	* get/set/enumerate properties

2010-10-20 11:42  zmoelnig

	* more on properties

2010-10-16 16:08  zmoelnig

	* notes

2010-10-16 16:06  zmoelnig

	* simple string->any map

2010-10-14 15:04  zmoelnig

	* PYLONified

2010-10-14 14:50  zmoelnig

	* non-working prototype for PYLON backend

2010-10-14 14:09  zmoelnig

	* example code how to get parameters

2010-10-14 12:12  zmoelnig

	* asynchronous frame grabbing
	  
	  this seems to give us way better framerates

2010-10-14 09:30  zmoelnig

	* only re-generate font if there is none
	  
	  previous code would re-generate the entire font each time the
	  text was updated.

2010-10-12 15:40  zmoelnig

	* when opening fails, reset the grabber to NULL (and fail to
	  grabImage if so).
	  also use defaults if no values are provided in the opener strings

2010-10-12 15:38  zmoelnig

	* Status should not be defined as "int"
	  
	  ouch: Xlib.h defines "Status" as "int", but Halcon uses "Status"
	  as a variable
	  name.

2010-09-30 11:57  zmoelnig

	* removed pix_drum/pix_mano from build process until we have a
	  makefile for them

2010-09-24 09:16  zmoelnig

	* include pix_mano/pix_drum

2010-09-24 08:40  zmoelnig

	* added jaime's pix_mano/pix_drum objects

2010-09-16 15:34  eighthave

	* replaced dead pure-data.org with puredata.info

2010-09-06 13:59  zmoelnig

	* allow negative indices
	  
	  should fix #3054193

2010-09-06 10:58  zmoelnig

	* hopefully better hashing algorithm

2010-09-05 17:32  nusmuk

	* add a multitexture example, with texture of 2 diferents size.
	  thanks to JACK

	* small bug fix about primitive size

2010-08-27 09:16  nusmuk

	* add .obj exportation exemple

2010-08-22 17:58  zmoelnig

	* glmTexture() has to be called before compiling the display lists

2010-08-17 12:44  zmoelnig

	* GEM_CHECK_LIB also defines HAVE_function

2010-08-17 09:58  zmoelnig

	* use "lqt_seek_video" is available

2010-08-17 08:43  zmoelnig

	* remove #warning

2010-08-17 08:41  zmoelnig

	* use frametable if possible

2010-08-16 13:42  zmoelnig

	* try to avoid seeking if next frame would be the requested frame
	  anyhow

2010-08-16 13:23  zmoelnig

	* added note about double-size...

2010-08-07 18:24  zmoelnig

	* implemented fromARGB()
	  
	  
	  v4l2 devices with FMT_RGB32 return ARGB -> now
	  we finally have to correct colors!

2010-08-07 17:44  zmoelnig

	* forgot to check for "-fPIC"
	  
	  "-fPIC" is needed on x86_64...

2010-08-04 11:29  zmoelnig

	* fromBGRA() is now implemented

2010-08-04 10:05  zmoelnig

	* more verbose output; comment about why RGB32 is a bad idea

2010-08-02 13:22  zmoelnig

	* include <sys/stat.h> to use fstat
	  
	  backport of ubuntu patch

2010-07-15 15:12  zmoelnig

	* added recordV4L and recordV4L2

2010-07-15 11:41  nusmuk

	* change the draw message from fill to default

2010-07-15 11:40  zmoelnig

	* less verbose output

2010-07-15 11:32  zmoelnig

	* made the V4L2 loopback device work

2010-07-15 10:23  zmoelnig

	* skeleton for recordV4L2

2010-07-14 17:56  zmoelnig

	* added (disabled) code from effectv to show how to react on ioctls
	  from the
	  client

2010-07-14 15:32  zmoelnig

	* we can now write to a v4l loopback device

2010-07-14 13:06  zmoelnig

	* more skeleton (still no functionality)

2010-07-14 12:59  zmoelnig

	* skeleton for a pix-output to v4l loopback

2010-07-14 12:45  zmoelnig

	* careful with auto_ptr and copy-assignment
	  
	  override assignment operator in order to prevent crashes.
	  fixes #3029467

2010-07-14 12:12  zmoelnig

	* moved comment to the proper place

2010-07-14 11:11  zmoelnig

	* support for non-libv4l
	  
	  "open()" and the like need to by FQND'd ("::open()") in order to
	  not interfere
	  with class methods ("videoV4L::open()")

2010-07-14 11:03  nusmuk

	* add repeat(int) and quality(int) message to pix_imageInPlace

2010-07-14 10:33  nusmuk

	* pix_imageInPlace crash if you preload images, and then click on
	  download, without creating a windows first.
	  this commit should fix this bug.

2010-07-13 07:25  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up code a bit
	  
	  changed "post" to "verbose"
	  TODO: shared memory for w32

2010-07-13 07:23  zmoelnig

	* "force install verbose" autoreconf

2010-07-09 12:20  zmoelnig

	* prevent double-binding of [pix_filmQT]
	  
	  Pd bails out if we call class_addcreator() 2 times for the same
	  name/ctor.
	  it probably should check

2010-07-09 12:10  zmoelnig

	* "open"-message is now an alias for both "startRendering()" (with
	  no args) and for "driver" (with 1 arg; for compatibility reasons)

2010-07-09 11:41  zmoelnig

	* this configure is for Gem's extras

2010-07-08 17:34  zmoelnig

	* svn-version is now handled by make rather than autoconf

2010-07-08 17:33  zmoelnig

	* optionally add objectname/object to the generic exception handler
	  
	  this allows the generic handler to display the correct
	  object-name

2010-07-08 12:22  zmoelnig

	* untested support for bayer-images

2010-07-02 19:33  zmoelnig

	* renamed gemversion.sh to pkgversion.sh

2010-07-02 19:16  zmoelnig

	* removed verbose printout

2010-07-02 19:09  zmoelnig

	* dynamic version handling
	  
	  LATER: turn "gemversion.sh" into a more generic "pkgversion.sh"

2010-07-02 11:18  zmoelnig

	* trying to workaround bugs in APPLE
	  
	  there is a bug in wordfree on OSX.
	  according to the following mail this can be worked around:
	  http://www.mail-archive.com/fink-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg28520.html

2010-07-02 11:15  zmoelnig

	* start of an autoversion system
	  
	  
	  i'd like to have the SVN-revision number in the build

2010-07-01 16:22  zmoelnig

	* long README

2010-07-01 15:40  zmoelnig

	* print UniqueID as hex

2010-07-01 15:34  zmoelnig

	* added TODO

2010-07-01 15:32  zmoelnig

	* probably working now (who knows)

2010-07-01 15:23  zmoelnig

	* at least it compiles
	  
	  now we need a GiGE camera to test this

2010-07-01 11:21  zmoelnig

	* AVT...

2010-07-01 11:19  zmoelnig

	* link against PvApi.lib rather than Halcon.lib

2010-07-01 11:18  zmoelnig

	* adapted LICENSE for use with AVT rather than HALCON

2010-07-01 11:16  zmoelnig

	* template for AVT-backend

2010-06-28 14:04  zmoelnig

	* better formatting

2010-06-28 14:00  zmoelnig

	* a small wrapper script to detect the current Gem-version
	  
	  the script should accept the environmental variables:
	  GEM_VERSION_MAJOR, GEM_VERSION_MINOR, GEM_VERSION_BUGFIX,
	  GEM_VERSION_CODENAME
	  
	  and take one of the flags:
	  --major
	  --minor
	  --bugfix
	  --codename

2010-06-28 13:35  zmoelnig

	* micro-version and codename now handled by configure

2010-06-28 10:37  zmoelnig

	* GEM_EXTERN -> GEM_EXPORT
	  
	  even for non-w32 plugins

2010-06-28 10:23  zmoelnig

	* fixed width/height
	  
	  accidentally, width and height were swapped resulting in weird
	  images.
	  this was easier to find out on w32, where there is actually
	  support for a camera i own (through DirectShow)

2010-06-28 10:00  zmoelnig

	* signed/unsigned comparision

2010-06-28 09:49  zmoelnig

	* made videoHALCON compile on w32

2010-06-28 09:48  zmoelnig

	* renamed scopeXYZto scopeXYZ~

2010-06-28 09:27  zmoelnig

	* signed/unsigned comparision

2010-06-28 08:48  zmoelnig

	* (dummy) M$VC-project files

2010-06-28 08:06  zmoelnig

	* updated help patches (according to max) and removed dupes
	  
	  closes #3021553, #3021551, #3021470, #3021461, #3021460

2010-06-28 07:36  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed bug crashing [scopeXYZ~]
	  
	  very small scope-buffers in combination with long dsp-blocks
	  could lead to
	  crashes; should be fixed now

2010-06-25 14:45  zmoelnig

	* renamed file to "scopeXYZ~"

2010-06-25 14:38  zmoelnig

	* seems to work so far (closes #2955520)

2010-06-25 13:20  zmoelnig

	* scopeXYZ~: at least something going on with the texcoords

2010-06-25 06:35  zmoelnig

	* fixing scopeXYZ~
	  
	  working, though not yet with textures

2010-06-23 14:56  zmoelnig

	* added videoHALCON

2010-06-23 14:52  zmoelnig

	* added README

2010-06-23 13:58  zmoelnig

	* simple parser for the device-string (using ":" as delimiter)

2010-06-23 13:42  zmoelnig

	* seems like autoconf now works

2010-06-23 11:12  zmoelnig

	* "Halcon::"ify the verbose output; notes on TODO

2010-06-23 09:42  zmoelnig

	* first working prototype
	  
	  "File" backend works (and it's the only one i can test)
	  TODO: selection of halconbackend, cameratype and device
	  (this has to be done via a single symbol!)

2010-06-22 14:12  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo (though configure-test don't work currently anyhow)

2010-06-22 13:59  zmoelnig

	* HALCON backend (non-functional)

2010-06-22 09:14  zmoelnig

	* added float-callback to start/stop the transfer

2010-06-22 09:14  zmoelnig

	* more verbose()ity

2010-06-22 08:51  zmoelnig

	* enumeration of DV4L devices

2010-06-22 08:50  zmoelnig

	* enumeration() now does some basic tests
	  
	  do some checks to find out whether a given device is really v4l1

2010-06-21 15:42  zmoelnig

	* check for v4l2 capabilities

2010-06-21 15:26  zmoelnig

	* enumerate() for videoV4L and videlV4L2
	  
	  TODO: videoV4L1 seems to get v4l2 devices as well
	  TODO: make sure that only capture devices are listed
	  (i think currently also output devices will be listed)

2010-06-21 14:43  zmoelnig

	* fixed symbolic-device selection for dc1394

2010-06-21 14:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug in the setDevice(int) code;
	  notes about the state-variables

2010-06-21 14:30  zmoelnig

	* added verbose()ity

2010-06-21 14:17  zmoelnig

	* more info

2010-06-21 14:04  zmoelnig

	* hopefully more robust device-changing

2010-06-21 13:06  zmoelnig

	* video-backends have to supply their name

2010-06-21 12:21  zmoelnig

	* removed [pix_indycam]: it's no longer here

2010-06-21 11:05  zmoelnig

	* don't initialized gem::PluginFactory<>::s_factory
	  
	  g++-4.5 is picky about double definitions

2010-06-21 11:03  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_PTHREADS; use CXX; ...

2010-06-21 11:02  zmoelnig

	* define HAVE_PTHREADS if pthreads are found

2010-06-21 10:59  zmoelnig

	* turned inside out (fixes: #3000166)

2010-06-16 16:45  zmoelnig

	* k32BGRAPixelFormat -> k32ARGBPixelFormat as suggested in #2980652

2010-06-15 09:39  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo where rgb2yuv would multiply by Y_OFFSET rather than
	  add to

2010-06-02 14:23  zmoelnig

	* updated configure.ac/Makefile to include all plugins;
	  little script to generate configure.ac

2010-06-02 14:22  zmoelnig

	* better guid handling

2010-05-26 17:10  zmoelnig

	* modify "libdir" so that it points to .../pd/extra/Gem:
	  this is where all the plugins (and Gem itself) should be
	  installed

2010-05-26 16:30  zmoelnig

	* checks for threads
	  
	  currently only pthreads are supported

2010-05-26 15:52  zmoelnig

	* allocate more memory for the target image
	  
	  gluScaleImage sometimes crashes when resizing to a a small
	  greyscale image
	  (25x25).
	  i suspect that it needs more "working" memory, so we allocate as
	  if the target
	  image where RGBA
	  
	  hopefully fixes #3007373

2010-05-26 15:48  zmoelnig

	* do not assume that greyscale-images have numpix%4=0
	  
	  fixes #3007370

2010-05-26 12:26  zmoelnig

	* use "unsigned int" where appropriate

2010-05-26 10:56  zmoelnig

	* dialogMess/enumerateMess

2010-05-26 10:37  zmoelnig

	* merged videoIndy into videoSGI
	  
	  just noticed that pix_videoindy really only provided an interface
	  to control the
	  camera of the indy; all the grabbing code has been gone long (was
	  it ever there)
	  
	  thus i moved the code over to the videoSGI plugin, but disabled
	  all the
	  functionality for now

2010-05-26 10:20  zmoelnig

	* moved pix_indycam into videoIndy
	  not working yet

2010-05-26 09:44  zmoelnig

	* fixed the OutputName

2010-05-26 09:33  zmoelnig

	* set output name to this weird convention...

2010-05-26 09:20  zmoelnig

	* OutputDir is always SolutionDir

2010-05-26 08:58  zmoelnig

	* updated M$VC project to include the videoDS and videoVFW
	  sub-projects

2010-05-26 08:55  zmoelnig

	* initialization in init-part of ctor

2010-05-26 08:51  zmoelnig

	* compiled/linked/loaded under windows
	  
	  no camera attached yet, however...

2010-05-26 08:16  zmoelnig

	* export the class rather than using GEM_EXTERN

2010-05-26 08:10  zmoelnig

	* renamed videoNT to videoVFW

2010-05-25 16:36  zmoelnig

	* catchGemException() is GEM_EXTERN

2010-05-25 16:32  zmoelnig

	* proper includes for w32

2010-05-25 13:43  zmoelnig

	* moved "close" towards canonical solution
	  
	  means: closing now works (again?)

2010-05-25 13:42  zmoelnig

	* return TRUE when stopping threads if no thread is present

2010-05-25 12:23  zmoelnig

	* use std::string rather tan "char*"; convert from YUY2
	  
	  i thought i've already done this a while ago...

2010-05-25 12:22  zmoelnig

	* M$VC projects for vfw backend

2010-05-25 12:11  zmoelnig

	* added fromABGR()

2010-05-24 18:07  zmoelnig

	* M$VC project (copied from filmDS)

2010-05-21 16:40  zmoelnig

	* normalized the "provide"d interfaces

2010-05-21 16:39  zmoelnig

	* PluginFactory interface and provides

2010-05-21 16:38  zmoelnig

	* dialog() now takes a vector of dialog-names to open;
	  if none are specified, all should be opened

2010-05-21 16:38  zmoelnig

	* this might compile now...

2010-05-21 16:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo in Makefile.am

2010-05-21 16:29  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up code without even trying to compile it

2010-05-21 16:29  zmoelnig

	* include the local config.h if possible

2010-05-20 16:43  zmoelnig

	* copied from pix_videoDarwin: more history!
	  
	  losing the history for the backendification...

2010-05-20 16:36  zmoelnig

	* use carbon-framework as well; frameworks not needed for CFLAGS

2010-05-20 16:35  zmoelnig

	* initial checkin (just a copy from pix_videoDS)

2010-05-20 16:16  zmoelnig

	* at least i got an image!

2010-05-20 15:49  zmoelnig

	* dialog/enumerate methods

2010-05-20 15:48  zmoelnig

	* proper initialization

2010-05-20 15:47  zmoelnig

	* ctor/dtor don't have return types...

2010-05-20 15:29  zmoelnig

	* at least it compiles...
	  
	  ZERO function tests have been made

2010-05-20 15:02  zmoelnig

	* no arguments for videoV4L2::ctor

2010-05-20 13:27  zmoelnig

	* not working at all yet...

2010-05-20 12:18  zmoelnig

	* might compile (or not; has to be tried)

2010-05-20 10:12  zmoelnig

	* videoSGI might work (or not, who can test that?)

2010-05-20 08:47  zmoelnig

	* moved pix_video{NT,SGI} into plugins
	  
	  not working at all for now; just moved files around...

2010-05-19 14:49  zmoelnig

	* fixed start/stop: should report expected status rather than
	  actual status

2010-05-19 13:49  zmoelnig

	* use the new DV4L implementation
	  
	  this implementation works for both the new juju stack and
	  the old dv1394 interface; the old implementation only worked
	  with the old dv1394 interface which is slowly vanishing from all
	  major
	  distributions...

2010-05-19 13:41  zmoelnig

	* protect against NULL-pointer to raw1394 structure

2010-05-19 13:11  zmoelnig

	* added videoDC1394 to the build

2010-05-19 13:02  zmoelnig

	* set m_width/m_height in the default setDimen() method

2010-05-19 13:01  zmoelnig

	* less verbose pluginfactory

2010-05-19 12:40  zmoelnig

	* implemented "channel" switching
	  
	  actually this is "mode" selection

2010-05-19 12:40  zmoelnig

	* removed swap/offset: no plugin implements them anyhow

2010-05-19 12:39  zmoelnig

	* removed offset/swap messages: no backend implements them anyhow

2010-05-19 09:59  zmoelnig

	* allow to query gem::video for all devices it provides
	  
	  [pix_video] can now do all the formatting itself;
	  gem::video doesn't print anything anymore when it is informed
	  that
	  it actually "provide"s something

2010-05-19 09:59  zmoelnig

	* also provide "iidc"

2010-05-19 09:58  zmoelnig

	* removed the test-exception

2010-05-19 09:58  zmoelnig

	* device-selection

2010-05-19 09:58  zmoelnig

	* handle exceptions in the plugin-ctors

2010-05-18 13:58  zmoelnig

	* frame locking (does it work?)
	  less verbose

2010-05-18 13:55  zmoelnig

	* got an image!

2010-05-18 10:24  zmoelnig

	* convenience method "usleep"

2010-05-18 09:54  zmoelnig

	* replaced "char*" by "std::string"

2010-05-18 09:26  zmoelnig

	* reverted all changes from the last few days and re-started
	  with the original code
	  
	  at least this doesn't freeze my system...

2010-05-17 12:46  zmoelnig

	* multiple locks

2010-05-17 11:58  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the dimen-mess

2010-05-17 09:47  zmoelnig

	* implemented device setting...

2010-05-17 09:09  zmoelnig

	* more robust; default quality is "best"

2010-05-17 09:04  zmoelnig

	* added open/close messages

2010-05-17 08:29  zmoelnig

	* at least got an image...

2010-05-16 18:53  zmoelnig

	* use std::string instead of "char*"

2010-05-14 18:51  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up (lots of things are done in plugins/video)

2010-05-14 18:50  zmoelnig

	* debugging messages

2010-05-14 18:49  zmoelnig

	* use ::close()/::open() rather than close/open

2010-05-14 18:49  zmoelnig

	* made it compile; needs testing
	  
	  send my IIDC camera so i can do some proper tests...

2010-05-14 18:48  zmoelnig

	* only get frame if we haveVideo and are capturing

2010-05-14 18:47  zmoelnig

	* moved private data into PIMPL

2010-05-14 18:47  zmoelnig

	* open/close/start/stop methods to be called from outside;
	  
	  these automatically handle the capturing/haveVideo states and
	  start/close the threads

2010-05-14 16:36  zmoelnig

	* nono nothing yet

2010-05-14 15:38  zmoelnig

	* alternative implementation of libDV4L
	  
	  does not work yet

2010-05-13 15:03  zmoelnig

	* fixed linebreak

2010-05-13 15:02  zmoelnig

	* made it loadable by removing not-implemented methods from header

2010-05-13 15:02  zmoelnig

	* exception string is now a std::string() rather than a char*

2010-05-13 15:01  zmoelnig

	* don't include GemException.h for all objects

2010-05-13 14:59  zmoelnig

	* removed void comment

2010-05-13 14:58  zmoelnig

	* allocate memory for the error-string; could be a memleak

2010-05-13 14:57  zmoelnig

	* non-verbose output

2010-05-13 14:57  zmoelnig

	* compiles and i managed to get an image...^

2010-05-13 14:56  zmoelnig

	* upgrade to the new interface;
	  
	  seems to work; but needs more stress testing

2010-05-13 14:56  zmoelnig

	* experimental upgrade to the new interface.
	  no chance for testing yet.

2010-05-13 14:55  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up interface of gem::video
	  
	  added documentation on what a metthod is supposed to do;
	  breaks compatibility with all the implementations

2010-05-13 14:54  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up code of [pix_video] in preparation for the cleanup of
	  the
	  video-plugins

2010-05-11 18:52  zmoelnig

	* now i would like to get my hand on an IIDC camera and test it

2010-05-11 16:57  zmoelnig

	* start the transfer; frames are discarded though

2010-05-07 16:45  zmoelnig

	* build system kind of works

2010-05-07 15:04  zmoelnig

	* copied files from videoDV4L to videoDC1394
	  
	  no work has actually been done yet; so this won't work for now

2010-05-07 10:40  zmoelnig

	* refresh the buffer when requested from downstream for processing

2010-05-07 10:34  zmoelnig

	* resend the image on request
	  
	  at least set the "newimage" flag; if something downstream really
	  modifies the image, this might hav side effects; i cannot think
	  of a
	  fast implementation (without caching each frame) that would allow
	  that;
	  if people run into it, they should probably use [pix_separator]

2010-05-07 09:37  zmoelnig

	* when changing the dimension for pix_resize, this should trigger
	  setPixModified()

2010-05-07 08:49  zmoelnig

	* the triangle is really equal-sided and not equilateral
	  fixes #2979943

2010-05-06 14:15  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed bug when allocating sizes

2010-05-06 13:52  zmoelnig

	* updated glew to 1.5.4

2010-05-06 13:51  zmoelnig

	* updated GLEW

2010-05-02 15:58  zmoelnig

	* set the AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR to .

2010-05-02 14:28  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the pascal-strings' fprintf()ing, as pointed out
	  by matju.
	  
	  there are surely loads of other wrong printf() uses.

2010-05-02 14:25  zmoelnig

	* aclocal, autoconf, autoheader, automake
	  
	  according to http://www.seul.org/docs/autotut/, it should be this
	  order...

2010-05-02 14:18  zmoelnig

	* call autoheader before automake when running them manually
	  (hopefully fixes the w32 compilation issue)

2010-05-02 14:11  zmoelnig

	* note about where to get GLEW from

2010-04-28 09:14  zmoelnig

	* use autoheader
	  
	  additionally there's a small helper-function for debugging...

2010-04-28 08:53  zmoelnig

	* dummy implementations of pushd/popd

2010-04-28 08:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed bashisms

2010-04-28 08:08  zmoelnig

	* substitute "let" expression with "$(( ))"
	  
	  as suggested by https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh

2010-04-28 08:02  zmoelnig

	* removed bashisms when defining functions()

2010-04-28 07:59  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo in define (HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX rather than
	  HAVE_VIDE4LINUX)

2010-04-27 13:14  zmoelnig

	* manual implementation of autoreconf as fallback...

2010-04-27 12:47  zmoelnig

	* plugins are now prefixed with "gem_" (e.g. "gem_filmAVI.so")

2010-04-27 10:32  zmoelnig

	* check for existing pimpl

2010-04-27 10:21  zmoelnig

	* uglified & simplified the entire plugin-engine
	  
	  the PluginFactory used to crash a lot, so this is a new attempt:
	  skipped ClassId and hardcode it to std::string;
	  skip the map<ClassId, ctor_t> and replace it by a map<string,
	  void*>
	  that is handled in the PluginBaseFactory
	  
	  i have no clue about template programming, but if this is what
	  comes out then
	  IT IS REALLY AND UGLY HACK!

2010-04-26 09:59  zmoelnig

	* i think these are not needed...

2010-04-26 09:37  zmoelnig

	* stripped down to only run autoreconf

2010-04-23 12:57  zmoelnig

	* set the AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR to .

2010-04-23 07:14  zmoelnig

	* loadbang the [quality 0( messages to [pix_texture]

	  Date: Sat Apr 17 13:46:13 2010 +0200
	  
	  regenerated config.h.in

2010-04-16 17:37  zmoelnig

	* removed duplicate AC_CONFIG_FILES line

2010-04-16 17:36  zmoelnig

	* more stubs for automake

2010-04-16 17:35  zmoelnig

	* keep automake happy
	  
	  in order for automake to stay happy, it needs a file referenced
	  in
	  configure.ac that can be made from a .am file.
	  we use AMakefile(.am) for this, in order to not interfere with
	  the real
	  Makefile.

2010-04-16 17:34  zmoelnig

	* a local autogen.sh

2010-04-16 17:33  zmoelnig

	* regenerated

2010-04-16 17:33  zmoelnig

	* make automake happy

2010-04-15 14:26  zmoelnig

	* Makefile.am for m4 include paths
	  regenerated config.h.in

2010-04-15 14:18  zmoelnig

	* stub Makefile.am for m4-includes
	  
	  on OSX (with autoreconf-2.61 as from XCode(?)) autoreconf weill
	  not pass the
	  "-I /path/to/m4" flags and instead just ignore them, which will
	  produce
	  unusable configure scripts (because macros are not expanded)
	  at least the ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS line in the automake Makefile.am is
	  respected.
	  we therefore have a Makefile.am that just make sure that the
	  m4-directory is
	  found

2010-04-15 10:11  zmoelnig

	* fixed AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE: remove the "-Wall -Werror" thingy

	* functions to query the avaiolable keys and to load more plugins

2010-04-08 13:21  zmoelnig

	* "gem.path" setting (not yet tested)

2010-04-08 13:20  zmoelnig

	* only register "AVI" if there is no "DS" handle (mimicks old
	  behaviour)

	  factory

	* added LATER

2010-02-25 15:51  zmoelnig

	* uninstaller helper from

	* don't mention "PNG" in the documentation of pix_image

2010-02-09 17:20  zmoelnig

	* reverted 06.framebuffer_and_shader.pd since the reverted

	  requires the [pix_set] hack

2010-02-09 17:19  zmoelnig

	* Revert "handle rectangle and upside-down textures via the
	  GL_TEXTURE matrix"
	  
	  see whether this get's us going with all the shader stuff;
	  LATER this should be implemented again, but probably with more
	  careful thinking
	  
	  This reverts commit 79f68200fe8e265b2eeb824544693a3eb48bc57b.

	  problems with
	  flext

2010-01-29 11:25  nusmuk

	* add shader initialisation at each gem window creation

2010-01-29 08:57  zmoelnig

	  given value
	  (mostly needed for setting MODIFIED flags because the user sent a
	  message)

2010-01-28 11:30  zmoelnig

	* check for apple/ia64

2010-01-28 11:30  zmoelnig

	* protect filmDarwin not just by __APPLE__ but by
	  HAVE_CARBONQUICKTIME

2010-01-28 10:53  zmoelnig

	* check whether we are on Apple/ia64 before trying to compile code
	  that won't
	  work;
	  LATER use a real configure check for this

2010-01-28 10:38  zmoelnig

	* make CarbonQuicktime not disabling other image loading backends

2010-01-28 10:29  zmoelnig

	* added GemDylib.cpp to the project

2010-01-27 17:44  zmoelnig

	* fixed M$VC errors

2010-01-27 17:35  zmoelnig

	* removed GemState.h from GemBase.h; so we have to re-included
	  manually where
	  needed

2010-01-27 17:04  zmoelnig

	* a wrapper class for dylibs (loads a dynamic library and runs
	  functions therein)

2010-01-27 15:59  zmoelnig

	* removed verbosity

2010-01-27 15:54  zmoelnig

	* introduced CPPExtern::findFile() to wrap the canvas-stuff

2010-01-27 14:49  zmoelnig

	* also except std::string when creating an exception

2010-01-27 14:47  zmoelnig

	* canvas_makefilename() and friends really want a non-const
	  t_canvas*

2010-01-27 14:46  zmoelnig

	* canvas_makefilename() and friends really want a non-const
	  t_canvas*

2010-01-27 14:20  zmoelnig

	* const_cast<> because Pd needs them

2010-01-27 14:19  zmoelnig

	* const_cast<>s, because Pd declares loads of variables as
	  non-const even though
	  they really should be const

2010-01-25 16:51  zmoelnig

	* added checks for linker-flags '-bundle -mmacosx-version-min=10.3
	  -undefined dynamic_lookup'

2010-01-25 13:18  nusmuk

	* remove unused connections

2010-01-25 13:15  nusmuk

	* revert back the modification : this patch work like it use to...

2010-01-25 12:56  nusmuk

	* varius clean of the examples patchs

2010-01-25 12:37  zmoelnig

	* call setTexCoords() only once at the end of render()

2010-01-25 12:35  zmoelnig

	* use [pix_kaleidoscope] for a more interesting effect
	  ([pix_aging] is an"overlay" effect that does nothing to the
	  pixels)

2010-01-25 12:20  zmoelnig

	* use "texture ?" rather than "mode ?"

2010-01-25 12:19  zmoelnig

	* reset the texcoord matrix every single frame...

2010-01-25 10:41  zmoelnig

	* fixed deprecation define for MSVC

2010-01-22 18:51  nusmuk

	* adapting shader regarding the texture coordinate change in Gem

2010-01-21 11:22  zmoelnig

	* Merge branch 'GemState'
	  
	  Conflicts:
	  Gem/src/Base/GemState.cpp

2010-01-19 13:08  zmoelnig

	* on the way to using GemContextData<> even in "ordinary"
	  (non-multi-context) envs

2010-01-19 10:09  zmoelnig

	* added config.h to svn:ignore

2010-01-19 10:07  zmoelnig

	* setting svn:ignore externals for the source-trees

2010-01-19 10:04  zmoelnig

	* svn:ignore "*.d"

2010-01-11 17:08  zmoelnig

2010-01-11 12:55  zmoelnig

	* more C++cast fixes for OSX

2010-01-11 12:35  zmoelnig

	* replaced 'vector_unsigned_char' by 'vector unsigned char'

2010-01-11 11:22  zmoelnig

	* better accessors for GemContextData
	  
	  accessing a contextualized variable should now be transparent:
	  e.g.
	  <code>
	  GemContextData<int>value;
	  value=12;
	  int a=3*value+7;
	  </code>
	  
	  prefix/postfix (e.g.. "value++") doesn't seem to work though

2010-01-11 11:20  zmoelnig

	* reset the active texunit to #0 in pix_texture::postRender()
	  
	  this should avoid problems with upstream objects (and objects
	  rendered LATER without any explicit [pix_texture])
	  
	  we still need a proper solution for [separator] and multiple
	  texture stacks

2010-01-11 11:18  zmoelnig

	* [separator] now takes an extra argument to only separate specific
	  domains

2010-01-11 11:17  zmoelnig

	* added warning about multiple texunits and pushing/popping texmat
	  
	  this really needs to be fixed, as people getting constant openGL
	  errors
	  (over/underflows) when using mulitple texunits and [separator]

2010-01-11 11:15  zmoelnig

	* replaced anonymous indices of state->stackDepth with an enum in
	  GemMan

2010-01-11 10:46  zmoelnig

	* c++-casts

2010-01-11 10:42  zmoelnig

	* more fixes for C++ casts on OSX

2010-01-08 14:45  zmoelnig

	* fixed C++casts for OSX

2010-01-08 13:26  zmoelnig

	* more c++casts

2010-01-08 13:23  zmoelnig

	* replaced (int)atom_getfloat() by atom_getint()

2010-01-08 13:22  zmoelnig

	* static_cast<> for Output/

2010-01-08 13:22  zmoelnig

	* static_cast<> for Nongeos/

2010-01-08 13:21  zmoelnig

	* t_float cast

2010-01-08 13:20  zmoelnig

	* static_cast<GL...> for Geos

2010-01-08 13:19  zmoelnig

	* static_cast<float> in Geos

2010-01-08 13:18  zmoelnig

	* drawtype of curve3d is now a local enum

2010-01-08 13:17  zmoelnig

	* static_cast<int> of Geos

2010-01-08 13:16  zmoelnig

	* cast fixes in Vertex

2010-01-08 13:14  zmoelnig

	* removed some unneeded casts

2010-01-08 13:14  zmoelnig

	* fixed some bugs where atom_getint was used to get floats

2010-01-08 13:13  zmoelnig

	* scripted conversion from ccasts to c++casts

2010-01-08 12:56  zmoelnig

	* reinterpret_cast<t_newmethod>

2010-01-08 12:54  zmoelnig

	* reinterpret_cast<t_method>
	  
	  converted all the CCASTs to C++CASTS with:
	  for i in *.cpp
	  do
	  sed -e 's|(t_method) *\([^
	  ]*\)\([,)]\)|reinterpret_cast<t_method>(\1)\2|' -i "${i}"
	  done

2010-01-08 12:13  zmoelnig

	* more casts

2010-01-08 12:10  zmoelnig

	* float priorities

2010-01-08 12:09  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2010-01-08 12:08  zmoelnig

	* reinterpret_casts for pointers

2010-01-08 12:07  zmoelnig

	* more C++ casts (this time in Base/)
	  
	  i guess a lot of casts in osx/w32 specific code (GemWinCreateMac)
	  will not work as it is; changes should be rather trivial

2010-01-08 12:05  zmoelnig

	* use static_cast<> and reintpret_cast<> where appropriate

2009-12-23 18:27  zmoelnig

	* works ok but ignores upsidedown
	  (looks weird when used with [pix_texture] since the image is
	  correct but the relief is not)

2009-12-23 12:50  zmoelnig

	* indentation

2009-12-23 11:41  zmoelnig

	* prefixed all member variables with "m_" (this time it works);
	  still need to understand why it does not work anymore (and why it
	  used to only work with RECTANGLE textures)

2009-12-23 09:41  zmoelnig

	* prefixed all members with m_

2009-12-23 09:31  zmoelnig

	* indentation and started to rename variables for readability

2009-12-23 09:20  zmoelnig

	* no "filename" in the QTImage2mem code (needs cleanup)

2009-12-21 15:07  zmoelnig

	* handle rectangle and upside-down textures via the GL_TEXTURE
	  matrix
	  (this way, the Geos can be totally agnostic about the texture
	  type and
	  orientation)
	  LATER: imageVert, pqtorusknots, ripple and (evtl.) rubber might
	  not behave as
	  they should
	  LATER: check whether GL_TEXTURE matrix is really to be abandoned
	  in OGL-3.0

2009-12-17 17:00  zmoelnig

	* added note about texture matrix

2009-12-17 12:56  zmoelnig

	* load all images upside down

2009-12-15 13:26  zmoelnig

	* updated config.{sub,guess}

2009-12-15 13:06  zmoelnig

	* fixed paths; now it compiles from svn

2009-12-15 12:51  zmoelnig

	* fixed path to ChangeLog

2009-12-15 12:47  zmoelnig

	* from my debian packaging efforts

2009-12-14 21:37  zmoelnig

	* don't use general namespace avm:: but use it explicitely when
	  needed (eg. for StreamInfo)

2009-12-14 10:41  zmoelnig

	* moved code into the mutexlocked parts to avoid crashes

2009-12-07 18:41  zmoelnig

	* use namespace "avm" for avifile-things

2009-12-07 11:21  zmoelnig

	* [gemwin] no longer sets the default framerate (instead this is
	  queried from
	  'window.fps' and (re)set in GemMan::resetState()

2009-12-07 11:19  zmoelnig

	* rectangle.texture and rectangle.pbo is now set via GemSettings

2009-12-07 11:17  zmoelnig

	* made framerate settable via GemSettings;
	  [print( gemwin now also prints all the GemSettings

2009-12-07 09:14  zmoelnig

	* added notes about cocoa

2009-12-01 15:02  zmoelnig

	* [separator] now also stores the projection matrix;
	  added a little doc on what is actually separated

2009-11-30 13:17  zmoelnig

	* back to not-printing the settings

2009-11-30 13:14  zmoelnig

	* oops forgot to recompile before committing...here we go

2009-11-30 13:10  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos: "treshold" no really reads "threshold" (uhah, this
	  makes patches
	  incompatible)

2009-11-30 11:34  zmoelnig

	* don't call wordfree() on OSX as this is buggy (makes endless
	  calls to memfree of non-aligned pointers)

2009-11-30 11:11  zmoelnig

	* error checks for wordexp()

2009-11-28 23:05  zmoelnig

	* fixed documentation (closes #2905446)

2009-11-27 22:23  zmoelnig

	* bashisms

2009-11-27 22:10  zmoelnig

	* removed debugging output

2009-11-27 22:08  zmoelnig

	* added glGetIntegerv();
	  fixed glGetFloatv();

2009-11-27 21:00  zmoelnig

	* added a note about dynamic lights

2009-11-27 20:58  zmoelnig

	* check whether we are rendering (that is: have a valid GLcontext)
	  before calling stopRendering() in the destructor

2009-11-27 20:56  zmoelnig

	* don't call glClearColor() without a window (might crash with some
	  drivers)

2009-11-26 17:49  zmoelnig

	* compiles on w32 again

2009-11-26 14:44  zmoelnig

	* don't print settings

2009-11-26 14:04  zmoelnig

	* more verbose

2009-11-26 13:29  zmoelnig

	* example file

2009-11-26 12:44  zmoelnig

	* settings for various aspects of the gemwindow and the
	  font-renderer

2009-11-26 12:44  zmoelnig

	* convenience methods;
	  DEFAULT_FONT

2009-11-26 10:40  zmoelnig

	* set the settings-file via environment variables GEM_SETTINGS

2009-11-26 10:24  zmoelnig

	* almost there: legacy support for env-variables; code cleanup

2009-11-26 08:49  zmoelnig

	* renamed the runtime settings to GemSettings

2009-11-25 17:55  zmoelnig

	* simple implementation of RealtTime configuration

2009-11-25 15:41  zmoelnig

	* a bit of explaining what is going on

2009-11-25 15:30  zmoelnig

	* conf

2009-11-25 14:53  zmoelnig

	* check whether QuickTime init succeeded before trying to close()

2009-11-24 17:12  zmoelnig

	* use GemCGLint instead of CGLint to handle different CGLversions

2009-11-24 10:35  zmoelnig

	* tyr handling outdated CGL-versions;
	  really people should rather upate....

2009-11-05 17:35  zmoelnig

	* strrchr() returns "const char*"

2009-10-31 16:49  zmoelnig

	* hopefully got the texenv right

2009-10-28 13:04  zmoelnig

	* less warnings...

2009-10-28 13:00  zmoelnig

	* undef HAVE_CONFIG_H after inclusion of config.h

2009-10-27 21:26  zmoelnig

	* cast filename to const char*

2009-10-27 21:16  zmoelnig

	* use "const char*" for open();
	  fixed some signed/unsigned comparisions

2009-10-22 17:09  zmoelnig

	* an experimental cubemap-texture object; this should later be
	  merged into [pix_texture]

2009-10-21 12:48  zmoelnig

	* nada

2009-10-18 13:41  zmoelnig

	* on w32 define "close" as "_close" (shouldn't this be: on MSVC
	  rather than W32?)

2009-10-15 17:03  zmoelnig

	* added GemException files to build

2009-10-15 17:02  zmoelnig

	* Release no builds with ARToolKit support, wherease ReleaseDummy
	  builds without

2009-10-15 16:43  zmoelnig

	* removed inclusion of Base/GemConfig.h as this has to be handled
	  locally

2009-10-15 16:33  zmoelnig

	* export the _setup function on w32;
	  added guard to not call the class_new() twice

2009-10-15 16:14  zmoelnig

	* added M$VC-project;
	  removed "#warning" directives, since M$VC doesn't really like
	  them

2009-10-15 16:07  zmoelnig

	* removed configDarwin.h.in: either use autoconf's config.h.in or
	  configDarwin.h

2009-10-15 16:01  zmoelnig

	* autoheaders generated stuff

2009-10-15 15:59  zmoelnig

	* config-related stuff

2009-10-15 15:58  zmoelnig

	* simplified CPPExtern.h;
	  moved GemExceptions into a separate file

2009-10-15 11:49  zmoelnig

	* this now compiles as an external for Gem

2009-10-15 11:49  zmoelnig

	* import/export handling for M$VC (on the way to provide a
	  mechanism for GEM-externals)

2009-10-15 11:35  zmoelnig

	* almost got it working (though tiny changes to Gem are needed)

2009-10-15 07:58  nusmuk

	* correct sentense about rendering order

2009-10-15 07:41  zmoelnig

	* slowly goes the night: still not really working M$VC project
	  (linker fails)

2009-10-15 07:17  zmoelnig

	* added banner when compiled as a Gem-external;
	  properly include GemConfig.h
	  (LATER this really should use its own config)

2009-10-14 08:55  zmoelnig

	* protect against NULL-canvases (e.g. when invoking the loader via
	  "-lib")

2009-10-13 15:07  zmoelnig

	* moved the installer target into a separate project

2009-10-13 14:34  zmoelnig

	* removed pix_artoolkit from Pixes and added pix_artoolkit project

2009-10-13 14:33  zmoelnig

	* added _snprintf() magic for M$VC

2009-10-13 14:32  zmoelnig

	* removed _snprintf() magic (it has nothing todo with configNT.h)

2009-10-13 14:31  zmoelnig

	* an M$VC-project for pix_artoolkit;
	  small change to pix_artoolkit.cpp to fix LNK2019 (check whether
	  this breaks something on other platforms)

2009-10-13 13:24  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo in preprocessor code

2009-10-13 13:22  zmoelnig

	* M$ needs stupid aliases for snprintf()-like functions

2009-10-07 20:36  zmoelnig

	* use "data" instead of "pdata";
	  pdata is mainly here to get the alignment of data right;
	  using pdata will be slower (not-aligned) and wrong (pixel offset)

2009-10-01 10:08  zmoelnig

	* ...

2009-10-01 10:00  zmoelnig

	* moved pix_artoolkit into src/extra/ in order to reduce
	  dependencies of core Gem

2009-10-01 09:59  zmoelnig

	* adapted to new preprocessor magic

2009-10-01 09:23  zmoelnig

	* indentation for better readability

2009-09-30 17:25  zmoelnig

	* don't ignore return value of fread()

2009-09-30 17:15  zmoelnig

	* removed traces of ???_NEW defines

2009-09-30 16:51  zmoelnig

	* by default, don't strip the binary created

2009-09-30 16:31  zmoelnig

	* include GemConfig.h when necessary and NOT in CPPExtern;
	  less dependency quirks

2009-09-30 15:12  zmoelnig

	* another cleanup of the configure stuff in order to get the
	  film/video-OS stuff right;
	  this still needs code changes on the backend side

2009-09-30 13:30  zmoelnig

	* use GL_FALSE/GL_TRUE rather than -1/0

2009-09-30 13:23  zmoelnig

	* cleanup model when re-opening or open failed

2009-09-30 11:41  zmoelnig

	* regnerated configure.ac for cleaner code (not much happened
	  though)

2009-09-30 11:40  zmoelnig

	* try to reduce warnings by not-ignoring the result of scanf/gets

2009-09-28 14:42  zmoelnig

	* added "print" message to print all the control-points to the
	  console;
	  setSpherical now uses degree rather than radians (conforming to
	  everything else in Gem)

2009-09-24 13:45  zmoelnig

	* dummy file to be included if there is no autoconf-generated
	  config.h file

2009-09-23 17:57  zmoelnig

	* renamed configLinux.h.in to config.h.in;
	  on osx the default should be to use the pix_filmOS

2009-09-23 17:15  zmoelnig

	* set "newfilm"-flag (LATER think whether this shouldn't be called
	  automatically by [pix_texture])

2009-09-23 14:31  zmoelnig

	* renamed Base/config.h to Base/GemConfig.h;
	  later we will change the file generated by autoconf from
	  config(Linux|Darwin|Generic|*).h to config.h;
	  and use HAVE_CONFIG_H to include it

2009-09-23 13:12  zmoelnig

	* configure-flags to set the default-font;
	  check for <FTGL/ftgl.h> (check still fails) and include that
	  instead if possible

2009-09-23 12:03  zmoelnig

	* fixed a lot of warnings appearing with "-Wall"

2009-09-22 16:49  zmoelnig

	* HACK: allow negative tracks for changeImage() to indicate that
	  the "next" frame should be taken and the requested frame should
	  be ignored;
	  really: negative frame# would be better (can these ever appear in
	  some weird container? more likely than negative tracks...)

2009-09-22 09:58  zmoelnig

	* merged back fixes from 0.92 branch (2876-2927)

2009-09-21 18:15  zmoelnig

	* experimental dynamic render tick: if rendering takes too long we
	  try to shorten the time till the next tick has to be
	  re-scheduled; don't know whether this really works

2009-09-21 16:09  zmoelnig

	* this code needs cleanup;
	  at least PBOs work now with rectangle textures

2009-09-21 14:40  zmoelnig

	* more todos

2009-09-18 06:54  zmoelnig

	* added notes about GemOutlet and the like

2009-09-17 11:43  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug when reducing number of iterations for YUV & Gray;
	  hopefully fixed RGBA issues on OSX/i386

2009-09-17 08:19  zmoelnig

	* removed [pix_filmNT] since on w32 we are using [pix_film] with
	  DS/QT/AVI(=NT) backend

2009-09-17 08:04  zmoelnig

	* removed [pix_filmQT]: it is not used anywhere and just makes
	  problems

2009-09-16 13:54  zmoelnig

	* changed type of GemVersion::versionString() from "const static
	  char* const" to "const static char*" (no more warnings on
	  g++-4.4)

2009-09-15 13:32  zmoelnig

	* at least find s_stuff.h if it is in a system-wide
	  include-directory

2009-09-14 13:01  zmoelnig

	* define __glx_h__ to avoid duplicate inclusion of glx.h

2009-09-13 14:02  zmoelnig

	* allow polygon/curve to have a variable number of vertices, simply
	  by not specifying them at creation time.

2009-09-13 13:59  zmoelnig

	* started todo 0.93

2009-09-12 12:24  zmoelnig

	* renamed TODO.092 to TODO.093

2009-09-12 12:23  zmoelnig

	* removed generated aclocal

2009-09-12 12:22  zmoelnig

	* added check for s_stuff.h (which doesn't find s_stuff in the path
	  specified by --with-pd yet; LATER fix this)

2009-09-10 10:01  zmoelnig

	* removed FFMPEG support (it's handled by gmerlin and it's broken
	  for ages)

2009-09-10 09:48  zmoelnig

	* changed __WIN32__ to _WIN32

2009-09-10 09:41  zmoelnig

	* less verbosity in gmerlin-backend

2009-09-09 16:22  zmoelnig

	* an extra directory for external objects

2009-09-09 15:59  zmoelnig

	* check whether we have a DivByZero when calculating the (not so
	  important) m_fps and avoid it;
	  this can happen with files recorded with Gem...

2009-09-09 14:19  zmoelnig

	* spigot to make this (still dummy) object less verbose

2009-09-09 14:18  zmoelnig

	* bumped version to 0.93cvs

2009-09-09 14:18  zmoelnig

	* put the "version" into a separate variable

2009-09-09 14:17  zmoelnig

	* merged back changes from 0.92

2009-09-09 10:30  zmoelnig

	* merged back the changes from the 0.92 branch that hopefully fixes
	  frame-wise seeking

2009-09-08 12:36  zmoelnig

	* try linking against libstdc++ in order to hopefully avoid
	  segfaults with buggy ati-drivers

2009-09-08 12:26  zmoelnig

	* added [openpanel] to example-patch to allow users to select their
	  own movies

2009-09-08 12:19  zmoelnig

	* dis/enabled rendering chains in the example

2009-09-08 11:05  zmoelnig

	* copy the entire state and not just a reference to it

2009-09-08 10:00  zmoelnig

	* disable printInfo() until glew has been initialized (should fix
	  crashes with glGetString())

2009-08-24 18:06  zmoelnig

	* reverted the fuzz of the last commit: it didn't work as expected

2009-08-24 17:47  zmoelnig

	* fixed texCoords when texture is upside down;
	  LATER: unify this and make all textures upside-down

2009-08-24 17:22  zmoelnig

	* introduced texUpsideDown flag in GemState to indicate whether we
	  have an upside down texture
	  (needed by some goes to get the image right)

2009-08-24 10:09  zmoelnig

	* added text-description of "string"

2009-08-20 13:01  zmoelnig

	* added destructor to cleanup

2009-08-18 20:33  nusmuk

	* add a string message

2009-08-18 15:34  zmoelnig

	* whitespace...

2009-08-18 15:31  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2009-08-10 10:49  zmoelnig

	* hopefully better to read uniform-handling

2009-08-10 10:48  zmoelnig

	* added startpost() and a bit of logic to not always show the
	  object's name

2009-08-08 18:01  zmoelnig

	* glTexImage2D

2009-08-04 14:17  zmoelnig

	* removed double class_addmethods()

2009-07-24 20:47  nusmuk

	* adding new exemple (double iterative).

2009-07-24 02:10  nusmuk

	* add a scale option, because the flag is smaller on osX than in
	  linux...

2009-07-23 19:54  nusmuk

	* add 2 new exemple of commun used GEMgl object

2009-07-23 15:48  zmoelnig

	* probably fixed upside-down issue of [pix_draw]

2009-07-22 20:30  zmoelnig

	* added a "--without-ALL" option to disable all "with"-options by
	  default (can be explicitely overridden)

2009-07-19 16:34  zmoelnig

	* more verbose when generating texture coordinates

2009-07-16 12:12  nusmuk

	* clean a bit this example : gemlist is no more banged with 0 and 1
	  gem_state message.

2009-06-24 16:33  zmoelnig

	* removed empty lines

2009-06-24 14:36  zmoelnig

	* added doc about the [thread $1( message

2009-06-23 08:29  zmoelnig

	* applied max's patch to get number of frames and finished-bang

2009-06-15 11:53  zmoelnig

	* removed the declarations for start/stopRendering() as they are
	  not implented

2009-06-09 17:18  eighthave

	* added missing - to make it the proper --export-dynamic

2009-06-03 07:42  zmoelnig

	* oops, missing ","

2009-06-02 21:15  zmoelnig

	* removed unused code; initialize member variables in the
	  initializer

2009-06-02 21:13  zmoelnig

	* removed unused code

2009-06-02 21:12  zmoelnig

	* removed unused code

2009-06-02 21:10  zmoelnig

	* removed unused code

2009-06-02 14:06  zmoelnig

	* added warning when using unnormalized values; fixed help-patch

2009-06-02 13:04  zmoelnig

	* removed methods that are present in the parent-class anyhow

2009-06-02 12:48  zmoelnig

	* removed unneeded variable(s)

2009-06-02 12:48  zmoelnig

	* reordered initialization to match header-file

2009-06-02 12:23  zmoelnig

	* added new modules to the project

2009-06-02 09:22  zmoelnig

	* mainly rearranged the order of appearance of member/variables in
	  the initializer;
	  [vertex_model] now uses glmTexture() rather than the nonexistant
	  glmLinearTexture()

2009-06-02 09:20  zmoelnig

	* removed unneded variables and commented out code

2009-06-02 09:16  nusmuk

	* add driver dv / driver v4l2 messages in the help file.

2009-06-02 08:39  zmoelnig

	* if all values are <=1 then we assume that they are "normalized"

2009-06-02 08:09  zmoelnig

	* use the "provide()" method for displaying the capabilities

2009-06-02 07:47  zmoelnig

	* added symbolic IDs for backend-identification: now we can just
	  use [driver dv( instead of [driver 2( (or was it [driver 3(?)

2009-05-28 13:21  zmoelnig

	* removed some verbosity when loading models; PBuffer nameclashes

2009-05-28 13:08  zmoelnig

	* replaced all fprintf/printf by post/error

2009-05-28 12:39  zmoelnig

	* replaced calls to fprintf(stderr,...) with calls to printf() (no
	  post() available in libs)

2009-05-28 11:36  zmoelnig

	* better regeneration script for GL-defines that does not nest 'if'
	  (problems on MSVC)

2009-05-28 11:22  zmoelnig

	* made it compile on w32 again

2009-05-28 09:20  zmoelnig

	* introduced new GEM_MULTICONTEXT define for multi-context
	  rendering;
	  implemented a first draft of the multi-context state-machine in
	  GemBase.
	  this needs some more thinking about which methods should do what:
	  e.g.:
	  - render(): get's called for each context
	  - startRendering()/stopRendering(): initialize/deinitialize
	  context-specific data (displaylists, textureIDs,...)
	  get's called for each context if "something has changed",
	  indicated by setModified() (?)
	  this could as well be a single contextModified() function
	  - stopRendering(): is really not useful in a multi-context
	  environment (should it only get called if all rendering-contexts
	  have been destroyed?)
	  - update(): multiple-contexts can render a- and synchronously, so
	  render() should not do anything time-specific (like incrementing
	  counters); updaet() should get called whenever time has moved on.
	  (e.g. update(deltatime););
	  - what to do with non-opengl specific things, e.g. pixes?
	  - ...

2009-05-28 08:03  zmoelnig

	* removed unused code (mostly: empty function calls)

2009-05-28 07:57  zmoelnig

	* moved comments around so they actually comment on the correct
	  line of code

2009-05-26 18:04  zmoelnig

	* a help-patch for [sphere3d]

2009-05-26 18:00  zmoelnig

2009-05-25 14:46  zmoelnig

	* fixed destroy

2009-05-25 14:45  zmoelnig

	* minor adjustments

2009-05-25 14:00  zmoelnig

	* hook for window deletion;
	  build [gemglutwindow] as a separate object (not part of Gem)
	  GemContext can also be queried for a numeric context id (later we
	  need this for context-dependent data, like displaylists)

2009-05-25 10:08  zmoelnig

	* make sure that the setup function is only called once

2009-05-24 19:14  zmoelnig

	* provide getGlewContext() functions

2009-05-23 14:11  zmoelnig

	* use generated code (and avoid the ifdefs as we are now using lew
	  and everything is defined anyhow)

2009-05-23 12:04  zmoelnig

	* derived [gemglutwindow] from a very simple GemContext class which
	  will hopefully handle glewcontext switches

2009-05-23 11:41  zmoelnig

	* replaced client_storage_supported, texture_range_supported,
	  texture_yuv_supported, multisample_filter_hint by their GLEW
	  equivalents

2009-05-23 11:29  zmoelnig

	* directly query glew rather than caching the results in GemMan
	  (think about multiple contexts!)

2009-05-23 08:16  zmoelnig

	* some more improvements

	* a simple implementation based on glut

2009-05-22 08:18  zmoelnig

	* revived the src/Output/ directory;
	  the [gemextwin] therein won't compile as it is highly dependent
	  on the multiwin branch (or so it seems)

	* dunno

2009-05-22 08:16  zmoelnig

2009-05-20 18:33  zmoelnig

	* regenerated with newer aclocal

2009-05-20 18:06  zmoelnig

	* non-functional start of [gemwindow] the window-part of GemMan as
	  a separate object

2009-05-20 14:06  zmoelnig

	* ...

2009-05-20 14:00  zmoelnig

	* made the scene a bit more interesting (less likely to create
	  black snapshots)

2009-05-20 13:55  zmoelnig

	* an abstraction implementation of [pix_write] using [pix_snap] and
	  [pix_writer]

2009-05-20 13:54  zmoelnig

	* do not create inlets for offset/dimension (meaningless in this
	  object)

2009-05-20 10:49  zmoelnig

	* an object that writes pixes to disk (no snapshotting involved!)

2009-05-20 10:20  zmoelnig

	* use glew-variables to check whether a context has been
	  established rather than calls to GemMan::windowExists() (which
	  should be removed altogether)

2009-05-20 09:16  zmoelnig

	* removed 2nd instance of [gemlist]; removed double-initialization

2009-05-20 09:14  zmoelnig

	* replaced [gem_state] by [gemlist]

2009-05-19 17:35  zmoelnig

	* allow to set some default things in the non-cached GemState

2009-05-19 17:34  zmoelnig

	* more implemented

2009-05-19 16:18  zmoelnig

	* removed unneeded variable

2009-05-19 13:36  zmoelnig

	* implemented a bit of stereo and other things...

2009-05-19 10:40  zmoelnig

	* allow GEMglGetFloat() to use symbolic parameter names

2009-05-18 15:53  zmoelnig

	* uaeh, this is a lot of work to (still) do...

2009-05-18 11:59  zmoelnig

	* a not-yet replacement for [gemwin]

2009-05-18 11:56  zmoelnig

	* indentation

	* when no argument (or "0") is specified, use the default
	  render-order (50)

2009-05-14 14:56  zmoelnig

	* removed the hardcoded paths to shaders: the examples do not do
	  anything anyhow

2009-05-14 14:49  zmoelnig

	* fixed wrong documentation about negative render-order: -3 is
	  REALLY renderend BEFORE -10

2009-05-09 19:56  zmoelnig

	* added sliders to set hue/sat/val

2009-05-09 19:42  zmoelnig

	* use a gop-subpatch to turn on/off rendering and handle

	* fixed bug that crashed Gem when loading a model without an openGL
	  context

2009-04-27 20:53  zmoelnig

2009-04-27 17:47  zmoelnig

	* updated M$VC projects

2009-04-27 17:43  zmoelnig

2009-04-27 07:30  zmoelnig

	  openGL context initialized...

	  hints on how to set evnironment for geometry-shaders in
	  glsl_program

	  still works on other hardware...)

2008-11-07 09:22  zmoelnig

	* added "copy" message to copy images from one slot to another;

	* some leftovers from the NEW<->OS rename action

2008-10-29 13:33  zmoelnig

	* renamed "pix_(video|movie|film)" to "pix_*OS" as these are really

	* 

2008-09-27 16:22  zmoelnig

	* GemExceptions should be thrown!

2008-09-17 14:07  zmoelnig

	* embedd GLconst->const interpreter, so now we can use directly use
	  [GEMglEnable GL_FOG] instead of quirks with [GLdefine];
	  this is done explicitely; there really should be a way to do it
	  implicetly for all GLenum types

2008-09-17 11:16  zmoelnig

	* use "const" arguments for getGLdefine() because the
	  arguments really are not changed;

	  covered by glew)

2008-09-09 13:43  zmoelnig

	* check whether GL_ARB_imaging is supported before trying
	  to push/pop the GL_COLOR matrix (fixes: bug#2008988)

2008-08-19 16:51  zmoelnig

	* constified a bit

2008-07-30 17:53  zmoelnig

	* included missing header ... now it compiles

2008-07-30 16:42  zmoelnig

	* removed some warnings in xcode;
	  introduced a new GemVersion class (needs more work on non-osx...)

2008-07-30 14:33  zmoelnig

	  (hopefully this is the last occurence...)

2008-07-23 13:49  zmoelnig

	* removed traces of wintab

2008-07-23 12:17  zmoelnig

	* created build-projects for OS-X;
	  LATER remove the leftovers Gem/GEM_darwin.*/

2008-07-23 12:13  zmoelnig

	* removed user-specific settings

2008-07-23 12:07  zmoelnig

	* moved "manual" into "doc" to have less clutter...

2008-07-23 12:05  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit

2008-07-17 08:05  zmoelnig

2008-07-08 16:45  zmoelnig

	* added prelaminary support for a freeframe1.0-loader, so people
	  can
	  directly use [pix_GlowVFX] instead of the clumsy [pix_freeframe
	  GlowVFX]

2008-06-16 10:38  zmoelnig

	* oops! forgot to check in a crucial part...

2008-06-16 10:23  zmoelnig

	* added error() when init() fails

2008-05-05 07:37  eighthave

	* Addressing bug #1941962
	  
	  The colors are still off using Pd-0.40.3-extended-20080502 on Mac
	  OS X 10.4.11
	  when this patch is run without adding the [pix_yuv], so I added
	  [pix_yuv] and

	* fixed spelling

2008-05-02 09:34  zmoelnig

	  some
	  gfx-cards which is better than freezing the machine

2008-04-30 17:46  zmoelnig

	* use messages "dimen" instead of "dim"

	  allow longer filenames (still hardcoded, but now up to 256
	  characters)

2008-04-22 09:35  zmoelnig

	* coming to an end (at least on w32)

	* ugly hack to make this object work on macintel

2008-04-17 14:33  zmoelnig

2008-04-14 17:02  zmoelnig

	* added defunct but compiling libfidtrack with objects

2008-04-11 18:47  zmoelnig

	  [pix_fiducialtrack] not useable on w32, but the object can be
	  created

2008-04-11 18:32  zmoelnig

	* added some libfidtrack-files (actually just
	  libfidtrack_segment.cpp);
	  libfidtrack_treeidmap() fails to link and libfidtrack_fidtrackX
	  depends on it)

2008-04-11 13:03  zmoelnig

	* moved stuff around to make it more readable

2008-04-11 12:55  zmoelnig

	* now test for lqt_open_write instead of lqt_open_video_track

2008-04-09 14:50  zmoelnig

	* seems to be stable now

2008-04-08 13:41  zmoelnig

	* made Debugthe default build-target again

2008-04-08 13:36  zmoelnig

	  compiled into Gem (in addition to the info which instruction-set
	  is used)

2008-04-08 13:32  zmoelnig

	* made Release-target compile (with MMX/SSE2 optimization)

2008-04-08 13:27  zmoelnig

	* hmm, YUV-MMX didn't do anything useful: should work now

2008-04-08 12:28  zmoelnig

	* try reducing dependencies a bit

2008-04-07 19:22  zmoelnig

	* added JPEG&TIFF support (oops, this crashes...)

2008-04-07 19:06  zmoelnig

	* seems like all of DS is compiling and linking now

2008-04-07 18:58  zmoelnig

	* include headers to make it compile again

2008-04-07 18:51  zmoelnig

	* enabled DS

2008-04-07 18:45  zmoelnig

	* include headers to make it compile again

2008-04-07 18:41  zmoelnig

	* slowly approaching: 1/2 of DS-code compiles

2008-04-07 16:11  zmoelnig

	* a working draft (no FTGL, image, DirectShow yet)

2008-04-07 15:33  zmoelnig

	* added a new project for M$VC2003 (not working yet)

2008-04-07 15:26  zmoelnig

	* minor fixes for m$vc

2008-04-07 15:24  zmoelnig

	* do not exclude the entire file on non-linux (should be handled by
	  the HAVE_DV macro; LATER rename it to HAVE_DV4L)

2008-04-07 15:21  zmoelnig

	* fixed missing return in isRunnable()

2008-04-07 15:18  zmoelnig

	* add format RGB32 in order to have an efficient vertex texture
	  fetching

2008-04-02 08:42  zmoelnig

	* use "rectangle" instead of "mode", use "dimen" instead of "dim"

2008-04-02 08:37  zmoelnig

	* install help-patches before examples

2008-04-02 08:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed help-patch bugs

2008-04-02 08:21  zmoelnig

	* cleared up the CPPExtern.h stuff a bit;
	  use "create_<classname>" as constructor callback rather than
	  "_class<classname>"

2008-04-02 08:18  nusmuk

	* *** empty log message ***

2008-04-02 08:13  nusmuk

	* added note on where the intel-cards like to crash on linux

2008-03-11 09:33  zmoelnig

	* fixed path

2008-03-11 09:33  zmoelnig

	* throw an error if shader cannot be loaded (instead of trying to
	  interpret
	  the "filename" as shader-program)

2008-03-11 09:16  zmoelnig

	* fixed parameters for the toon-shader

2008-03-10 16:48  zmoelnig

	* moved setup of context-sharing into GemWinCreate<OS>

2008-03-10 16:33  zmoelnig

2008-03-05 10:40  zmoelnig

	* probably got it right now

2008-03-05 10:31  zmoelnig

	* reverted the texture-hack

	* got rid of t_GLshaderObj in favour of GLhandleARB

2008-03-04 16:53  zmoelnig

	* glewified the openGL-wrapper objects that had ifdef's

	  openGL-objects still missing

2008-03-04 15:10  zmoelnig

	* make glew used always (not _really_ part of configure any more);
	  print an error at the very end of configure if openGL and/or
	  m_pd.h seem
	  to be missing

2008-03-04 14:28  zmoelnig

	* transmit GLuint's over t_float

2008-02-20 13:27  zmoelnig

	  width
	  (according to marius' feature-request)

2008-01-29 09:19  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos; rephrased to talk about "states" rather than
	  "pointers"

2008-01-29 09:12  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos; use init-feature of [tgl]; added 4th example

2008-01-24 14:01  nusmuk

	  "repeat"
	  trick...

2008-01-23 14:25  zmoelnig

	* added _mm_empty() at beginning of MMX processing; this seems to
	  fix the problem

2008-01-23 14:03  zmoelnig

	* proper casts

2008-01-23 12:27  zmoelnig

	* 1. moved most platform dependent code out of this object into
	  GemPixSave;
	  2. allow filenames up to MAXPDSTRING (and not just 80)

2008-01-23 12:25  zmoelnig

	* added autoflip to QuickTime code (e.g. if imageStruct holds an
	  image that is
	  NOT upside-down, it will be flipped to become a correct QuickTime
	  image)

2008-01-22 09:06  zmoelnig

	* use imageStruct memberfunctions to handle types and reallocation:
	  removes a lot of ifdefs and thus makes the code more readable

2008-01-22 08:49  zmoelnig

	* nothing...

2008-01-21 14:44  zmoelnig

	* fixed callbacks that accept lists

2008-01-09 21:12  cclepper

	* fixed window focus on 10.5. thanks to Keith Bauer for the code
	  tip!

2008-01-09 14:52  zmoelnig

	* initialize glew if USE_GLEW

2008-01-09 14:51  zmoelnig

	* there is no "long long" type in C++

2008-01-09 14:51  zmoelnig

2008-01-09 14:50  zmoelnig

	* removed stray semicolons

2008-01-09 09:02  zmoelnig

	* added information about the "glUnform2i" problem

2008-01-06 20:19  zmoelnig

	* use m_rectangle instead of m_mode

2008-01-06 20:18  zmoelnig

	* better checks for rectangle-support

2008-01-06 20:17  zmoelnig

	* replaced "mode" by "rectangle" (more meaningful)

2008-01-06 15:53  zmoelnig

	* renamed help-file for [gemlist] to match

2008-01-05 22:03  nusmuk

	  corner.

2008-01-02 16:38  zmoelnig

	* use the best available colorspace supported by Gem...

2008-01-02 16:10  zmoelnig

	* implemented feature-request #1854593 (don't reset fps when
	  [gemwin] is
	  created without arguments)

2008-01-02 15:26  zmoelnig

	* added another outlet for various information (e.g. codecs)

2008-01-02 15:26  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed bug that crashed Gem when recording another movie

2007-12-23 19:10  zmoelnig

	* removed dependency on non-Gem externals

2007-12-23 12:51  nusmuk

	* hopefully adapted to new avifile-API

2007-11-15 09:09  zmoelnig

	* include "infotypes.h" instead of "StreamInfo.h"; weird that on
	  ubuntu/gutsy
	  the both are not included automatically by "avifile.h"

2007-10-16 14:46  zmoelnig

	* removed MarkEx

2007-10-15 08:06  zmoelnig

	* removed dependency off Gem.$(EXT) on $(OBJECTS)

2007-10-14 16:41  cclepper

	* make Gem.$(EXT) .PHONY again

2007-10-11 14:44  zmoelnig

	  prepare GemSetup to add Gem's own path to the search-paths

2007-10-11 12:12  zmoelnig

	* cleanup objectfiles when they are in . instead of $(OBJDIR)

2007-10-11 12:09  zmoelnig

2007-10-08 09:11  zmoelnig

	* introduce a new type GL_RGBA_GEM which depends on the platform
	  (e.g. RGBA or ARGB)

2007-10-07 09:02  zmoelnig

	* added cyrille's suggestion for actively enabling the
	  depth test

2007-10-06 11:48  zmoelnig

2007-10-05 13:43  zmoelnig

	* reverted cgc's changes (since they duplicated my last ones...)

	* enables the first 8 texture units for multitexturing.

2007-10-04 15:50  cclepper

	* added min and max frame message for recording. uncommented output
	  of frame number in stopRecord().

2007-10-04 14:38  zmoelnig

	* added some missing minframe&maxframe stuff chris has forgotten to
	  comit...

2007-10-03 20:26  cclepper

	* added min and max frame message for recording. uncommented output
	  of frame number in stopRecord().

2007-10-02 10:58  zmoelnig

	* - remove the "-j 4" option from the subdirectory make
	  (this should be set outside of the Makefile)
	  - make the "strip" target depend on Gem.$(EXT)
	  (to make outside "-j" work correctly)

2007-09-29 17:40  zmoelnig

	* added newline at EOF

2007-09-28 11:50  zmoelnig

	* output correct dimensions when using 3d-textures
	  (this is: 1*1 rather then m_width*m_height)

2007-09-26 16:31  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation (fixed path)

2007-09-26 15:27  zmoelnig

	* changed (long int) to GLint so compilation doesn't choke on
	  recent headers...

2007-09-26 14:30  zmoelnig

	* don't do weird casts; rather use the correct type from the
	  beginning

2007-09-25 23:23  cclepper

	* silly Nvidia headers want a cast to GLint.

2007-09-21 19:12  zmoelnig

	* added another possibility to switch between various dv devices
	  (via numeric selectors)

2007-09-21 17:26  zmoelnig

	* put "default" target into */Makefile

2007-09-21 16:17  zmoelnig

	* call the <subdir>/Makefile instead of directly referring to
	  Makefile.subdir

2007-09-21 16:02  zmoelnig

	* a separate makefile for all subdirectories;
	  this can later be used for partly building Gem as separate
	  objects

2007-09-21 15:11  zmoelnig

	* use environmental variable to specify a different default font

2007-09-21 13:29  zmoelnig

2007-09-13 13:42  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed bug reported by cyrille

2007-09-13 13:41  zmoelnig

2007-09-13 12:45  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a bit (use the [pd gemwin])

2007-09-13 12:27  zmoelnig

	* made sure all the example-patches work

2007-09-13 11:14  zmoelnig

	* clamp the string-characters to 0..65535
	  (FTGL sometimes crashes if the wchar is >65535;
	  and in theory (wikipedia), ttf-fonts can only hold 2^16 glyphs)

2007-09-10 23:21  eighthave

	* cleaned up help patch to follow Gem standard

2007-09-10 22:43  eighthave

	* minor clean up and removed [mode( message since its not required
	  on ATI anymore

2007-09-10 22:39  eighthave

	* removed loadbang because it causes crashes on Mac OS X and is not
	  required on GNU/Linux (at least on my machine with an ATI X1600)

2007-09-10 22:38  eighthave

	* created a cleaned up, truly simple version, and testing it on
	  Ubuntu and Mac OS X

2007-09-10 21:40  eighthave

	* turned most of the help patch into functional examples instead of
	  just comments about the messages. The "viewing", "buffering" and
	  "steroscopic" sections still need examples

2007-09-10 21:39  eighthave

	* created help patch to document that t[pix_blur] is deprecated

2007-09-10 21:32  eighthave

	* added sliders to make playing with this example much easier

2007-09-10 21:18  eighthave

	* added a slider to make it easier to rotate

2007-09-10 10:44  zmoelnig

	* a unit-test framework (not yet finished)

2007-09-10 10:19  zmoelnig

	* cyrille has reported a crash with the [gemframebuffer] object;
	  this test triggers this crash

2007-09-10 10:15  zmoelnig

	* added argument to call of [pix_histo]

2007-09-03 14:18  zmoelnig

	* fixed crasher bug when [curve] was created without arguments

2007-09-02 14:54  zmoelnig

	* use "pix_video" as default help-file isntead of "pix_movie"

2007-09-02 14:40  zmoelnig

	* updated example patches a bit (according to Gijon) to use more
	  gui-elements

2007-08-29 14:54  cclepper

	* Help class should now open pix_video help file.

2007-08-25 19:47  zmoelnig

	* changed the help-symbol of the [pix_movieDarwin] to [pix_movie]

2007-08-25 19:43  zmoelnig

	* oops; removed the default number of points;
	  just assume 0, but allow creation

2007-08-25 19:42  zmoelnig

	* default to 4 inputs if none are present

2007-08-25 19:33  zmoelnig

	* accepted hans's changes to the documentation (this is: add the

	  required for DMA uploads on Intel now.

2007-08-01 21:33  cclepper

	* changed GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT to _ARB which seems to be
	  required for DMA uploads on Intel now.

2007-07-27 21:47  cclepper

	* OSX does 128 bit or 4k page boundary alignment automatically.
	  works pretty well on its own.

2007-07-27 21:45  cclepper

	* changed __PPC__ to __ppc__

2007-07-25 21:36  cclepper

	  and image flipping.

2007-05-31 17:52  zmoelnig

	* make old-images tiny (almost free them) when resizing the array:
	  important when you resize large arrays;
	  TODO: do not resize buffers that already have the correct size

2007-05-31 15:18  zmoelnig

	* added "resize" message

2007-05-30 14:49  zmoelnig

	* added "resize" message

2007-04-02 15:27  zmoelnig

	* fixed v4l2-code as to set the "m_capturing"-flag whenever we
	  exit the capturing thread (not just when we power it down);
	  
	  in pix_videoNEW do not startTransfer() in the constructor phase

2007-04-02 10:24  zmoelnig

	* incidentially deleted the "using std::string;" line...now it is
	  back

2007-04-02 10:18  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a bit

2007-04-02 07:36  zmoelnig

	* removed GLTT support;
	  added wide character support for FTGL-font rendering (at least in
	  "string" mode)

2007-03-14 10:57  zmoelnig

	* minor issue with using fprintf() without carriage return;
	  this solution uses verbose(), though i am not sure whether this
	  is really thread safe...
	  have i really forgotten to check this in...?

2007-03-12 09:15  zmoelnig

	* added saturated logic and made it default (is the LATTER a good
	  idea?)

2007-02-20 10:13  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos in comment

2007-02-20 10:11  zmoelnig

	* fixed comment

2007-02-20 09:58  zmoelnig

	* added a configure-flag to specify the maximum openGL-version to
	  use.
	  use this information in GemGL.h to exclude certain parts of the
	  openGL-headers
	  thanks ico for the suggestion

2007-02-20 09:56  zmoelnig

	* glBlendEquation() needs openGL-1.2

2007-02-20 09:43  zmoelnig

	* glActiveTexture() is not always defined

2007-02-20 09:42  zmoelnig

2007-02-19 11:29  zmoelnig

	* applied ico's patches in order to stabilize dv4l
	  (note: use delete[] on ~pix_videoNEW)

2007-02-13 13:11  zmoelnig

	* fixed cases for os-x includes (fixes bug#1613373)

2007-02-12 22:33  tigital

	* small changes to get correct colors on intel macs

2007-02-12 21:43  tigital

	* small change to get correct colors on intel macs

2007-01-07 22:32  tigital

	* added GL_VERSION_2_0 compile path for non-ARB glsl functions

2007-01-07 19:52  zmoelnig

	* proper calling of CPPExtern::error() in the static member
	  functions

2006-12-07 18:19  cclepper

	* quick fix for YUV 3x3 on x86. for now it just does the generic
	  loop.

2006-12-06 20:08  cclepper

	* added an ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX.
	  pix_filmDarwin is used instead

2006-12-06 19:56  cclepper

	* added an ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX.
	  pix_movieDarwin is used instead

2006-12-06 19:44  cclepper

	* added another ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX

2006-12-04 15:35  zmoelnig

	* sped things up a bit; cleaned up post()

2006-12-04 09:11  zmoelnig

	* added comment about initial state and a note, that you now can
	  set this
	  initial state via arguments

2006-12-04 09:09  zmoelnig

	* add an optional argument to the object, so the initial state can
	  be given at object creation (thanks cyrille for the request)

2006-11-25 20:04  zmoelnig

	* added "saturate" message to turn saturation on/off;
	  fixed bug in MMX code with gains>1;
	  added initial arguments

2006-11-21 12:10  zmoelnig

	* less warnings when compiling

2006-11-21 12:00  zmoelnig

	* nobody uses this and if they do, it wouldn't work anyhow

2006-11-21 11:58  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a tiny bit...

2006-11-21 11:57  zmoelnig

	* minor code cleanup

2006-11-21 10:10  zmoelnig

	* bail out when using wrong messages

2006-11-15 11:12  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo (it is __GNUC__ and not __GNUC___)

2006-11-15 11:08  zmoelnig

	* more verbosity when disabling the culprit altivec stuff (since
	  the code
	  does not seem to work and i don't know why...watch out for the
	  autobuild
	  logs tomorrow...)

2006-11-14 10:58  zmoelnig

	* disable YUV422_to_YV12_altivec() for gcc<4.0 via the
	  NO_VECTORINT_TO_VECTORUNSIGNEDINT define (the fix yesterday
	  coukdn't have worked);
	  btw YUV422_to_YV12_altivec() is really _unused_ in the current
	  sources!!

2006-11-14 10:34  zmoelnig

	* can't use methods with "float, symbol" type; have to use A_GIMME
	  instead

2006-11-13 15:49  zmoelnig

	* disabling __VEC__ for older gcc's (<4); LATER fix the code

2006-11-12 15:20  zmoelnig

	* print credits on first object creation

2006-11-12 15:14  zmoelnig

	* removed the default "HAVE_ARTOOLKIT"; this is checked by
	  configure

2006-11-12 15:05  zmoelnig

	* added shigeyuki's [pix_artoolkit]

2006-11-12 15:04  zmoelnig

	* checks for artoolkit

2006-11-08 20:30  zmoelnig

	* added example file for the use of [gemframebuffer]; note that i
	  use
	  [pix_texture] instead of [pix_multitexture]

2006-11-08 19:24  zmoelnig

	* removed the [pix_coordinate] stuff, since it is now unneccessary
	  (i thought i removed this already...)

2006-11-06 17:39  zmoelnig

	* fail to load movie when fps get's weird... (LATER fix the ffmpeg
	  code)

2006-11-06 16:48  zmoelnig

	* made film::m_auto protected; from outside it can now only be set
	  via setAuto(); this should make it easier to make optimized
	  decoding
	  paths for sequential reading (e.g. non-random-access)

2006-11-06 16:40  zmoelnig

	* better handling of decoding errors...

2006-11-03 16:50  zmoelnig

	* fixed calls to post()

2006-11-03 08:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed calls to ::error() and ::post()

2006-11-03 08:32  zmoelnig

	* added post() method to CPPExtern.cpp which automatically prepends
	  the
	  object's name (if available);
	  accordingly had to change a lot of uses uses of post() where
	  either the
	  object's name was hard- or softcoded or ::post() was used (in the
	  callback functions)

2006-11-03 08:26  zmoelnig

	* extended the texture-sharing message to: textureID, texCoords,
	  type, flags

2006-11-03 08:25  zmoelnig

	* fixed v4l-1 to work with my usb-2u-cam; v4l-2 starts to work
	  too...

2006-11-03 08:24  zmoelnig

	* updated info-files

2006-11-01 22:33  tigital

	* [pix_multitexture] now works as expected!
	  - new [dimen x y< message needed so that it can determine
	  texcoords
	  - GemShape's SetVertex() has been modified to loop thru
	  glMultiTexCoord2f, when needed
	  - GemState has new variable: state->multiTexCoords, which is 0 by
	  default, but set in pix_multitexture based on the # of texUnits
	  requested

2006-10-30 20:57  tigital

	* more attempts at fixes for bad type-ing of vec's on 10.3

2006-10-30 18:51  zmoelnig

	* added option to disable "-fPIC"

2006-10-30 18:45  zmoelnig

	* make "-Os" the default on Darwin

2006-10-30 18:37  zmoelnig

	* added more tests for compiler-flags as suggested by tigital
	  (-mpowerpc-gfxopt is turned OFF by default; LATER think about the
	  "-Os" flag on os-x)

2006-10-30 18:24  zmoelnig

	* reverted the type changes (while this still breaks compilation
	  with older gcc's, at least it is functional)

2006-10-30 08:47  zmoelnig

	* oops, fixed typo

2006-10-30 08:46  zmoelnig

	* added check for "-fpascal-strings" which allows us to use
	  pascal-strings (containing '\p') on os-x

2006-10-30 08:26  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix another error with types; NEEDS TESTING

2006-10-26 20:04  tigital

	* fixes for bad type comparisons in some vec_sl()/vec_add and loop
	  comparisons

2006-10-26 20:00  tigital

	* fix for gcc4 warning "'GemException' has virtual functions but
	  non-virtual destructor"

2006-10-22 19:51  zmoelnig

	* finally removed "configure" since it really should be generated
	  (and therefore happens to get out of sync with configure.ac too
	  often)

2006-10-20 17:48  zmoelnig

	* only call glUseProgramObjectARB() in postrender() when we have
	  a linked module (less crashy on systems that don't really support
	  shaders...)

2006-10-20 17:40  zmoelnig

	* changed type of for-loop variable from (size_t) to (singed long
	  long), since unsigned numbers never get negative!

2006-10-18 13:49  zmoelnig

	* store the CONFIGUREFLAGS in Make.config, so that automatic calls
	  to "configure" produce the same results;
	  additionally this should make it possible to just call:
	  'CONFIGUREFLAGS="--with-pd=/bi/ba/bo" make"
	  in a distclean environment and it will build everything;
	  LATER remove configure/aclocal.m4

2006-10-18 11:06  zmoelnig

	* setNorm() now has an effect even if capturing is currently not
	  running;
	  LATER think about making the "mode <norm> <channel>" message work
	  again (it seems like this is some threading problem)

2006-10-18 11:05  zmoelnig

	* fixed if/else at the "mode" message

2006-10-18 10:53  zmoelnig

	* hmm...

2006-10-18 10:52  zmoelnig

	* made it a tiny bit more readable; added accumbuffer-bits to
	  window-creation

2006-10-18 10:50  zmoelnig

	* example for texture-sharing

2006-10-18 10:46  zmoelnig

	* dont use markEx-objects anymore;
	  LATER remove this example altogether

2006-10-18 10:44  zmoelnig

	* dont use markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-18 10:43  zmoelnig

	* updated to use vera.ttf instead of arial.ttf and to not use
	  markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-06 14:53  cclepper

	* updated RGBA pixel packings for Mac Intel

2006-10-06 14:50  cclepper

	* update for proper Mac Intel pixel packing

2006-10-04 11:38  zmoelnig

	* proper initialization (memset(0)) for fidtrackerx (used to crash
	  on my x64_64)

2006-10-03 15:13  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the check whether OpenGL-framework is used

2006-10-03 15:08  zmoelnig

	* disable checks for libGL and libGLU if we use the
	  OpenGL-framework

2006-10-03 11:51  zmoelnig

	* disable checks for lqt and libquicktime if QuickTime-framework is
	  being used

2006-09-27 12:55  zmoelnig

	* deleted obsoleted objects from this list

2006-09-27 12:53  zmoelnig

	* make pd-binary settable via the PD variable

2006-09-27 10:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the test for AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL since we use c++
	  instead of cc

2006-09-27 09:53  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the FFMPEG-thing (the AVCodecContext-check was
	  broken
	  since i changed the language from "C" to "C++")

2006-09-27 09:04  zmoelnig

	* added some magic for FTGL and ffmpeg

2006-09-26 09:56  zmoelnig

	* use our own glew.h (if so)

2006-09-26 09:55  zmoelnig

	* glProgramEnvParameter4fvARB() can only be used if
	  GL_ARB_vertex_program is defined
	  (GL_NV_vertex_program doesn't matter)

2006-09-26 09:27  zmoelnig

	* removed check for "-no-builtin" gcc-flags, since this prevents us
	  from building with older gcc-version

2006-09-25 13:28  zmoelnig

	* regenerated glew from 1.3.4 sources;
	  fixed importGLEW.sh so that it automatically adds the "#ifdef
	  USE_GLEW"
	  clauses around the code

2006-09-21 19:36  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the not-deprecated linking flags on OSX;
	  disabled altivec on x86_64 machines

2006-09-21 14:38  zmoelnig

	* added newline at end of file

2006-09-21 14:32  zmoelnig

	* add generic inlets for each textureunit

2006-09-21 14:31  zmoelnig

	* added PDerror() which calls pd_error() without having to worry
	  about the object ("ourselves")

2006-09-20 15:57  zmoelnig

	* disabled Vertex by default (since it is very experimental)
	  disabled SSE2 by default (since most processors do not yet
	  support it)

2006-09-20 15:56  cclepper

	* added glfrustum call with GEM default setting. Uncommented some
	  of the matirx calls which get closer to correct rendering.

2006-09-20 15:51  zmoelnig

	* indentation of preprocessor-directives, so i can read them

2006-09-20 07:55  zmoelnig

	* removed the legacy HaveValidContext() function call (since it
	  does no longer exist)

2006-09-19 20:48  cclepper

	* init m_FBOcolor not m_color

2006-09-19 20:43  cclepper

	* added a color message to set the background color.

2006-09-18 11:09  zmoelnig

	* another check for illegal filenames

2006-09-18 10:39  zmoelnig

	* removed MarkEx from Gem

2006-09-18 10:39  zmoelnig

	* removed dependency on [v+] and friends (which are no longer part
	  of Gem)

2006-09-17 15:41  zmoelnig

	* put "float seconds;" in the platform-independent section, since
	  it is used by both __APPLE__ and __WIN32__

2006-09-15 18:15  tigital

	* [OSX] small fix for close() definition

2006-09-14 09:44  zmoelnig

	* hopefully made this work with older openGL-headers

2006-09-14 09:20  zmoelnig

	* put the authors into GemVersion.h and removed the OS-information
	  (since this is blurry)

2006-09-14 09:00  zmoelnig

	* w32 batch file for testing;
	  LATER make this via make

2006-09-12 22:38  cclepper

	* updated to include timers and matrix flipping on windows

2006-09-12 19:58  cclepper

	* adds a timer for the movie framerate on windows. also flips the
	  image around when a directshow source is used.

2006-09-12 19:44  cclepper

	* added header for GLEW

2006-09-12 19:43  cclepper

	* Quicktime init on first launch for Windows. This could possibly
	  go in GemWinCreateNT, but it works fine here.

2006-09-12 19:40  cclepper

	* GLEW init code for Windows

2006-09-12 19:37  cclepper

	* added a working SIMD feature check for Windows.

2006-09-11 21:56  cclepper

	* m_auto is passed to the handle. useful for DirectShow and
	  Quicktime which are more efficient handling auto play than just
	  incrementing a frame counter.

2006-09-11 21:55  cclepper

	* moved m_auto to public member variable

2006-09-11 21:53  cclepper

	* added right inlet frame handling and auto now sets rate

2006-09-07 21:28  cclepper

2006-09-05 15:27  tigital

	* added more informative output when changing mode

2006-09-03 16:50  zmoelnig

	* removed inheritance of GemException from std::exception to not
	  set up M$VC; hope this works

2006-09-02 18:37  zmoelnig

	* use "-path" for searching images

2006-09-02 18:37  zmoelnig

	* added installabs target for installing abstractions;
	  install Gem.${EXT} into pd/extra/Gem/

2006-08-31 19:45  cclepper

	* added a message apative to set the threshold for deinterlacing.
	  also attempted to make the deinterlacing a little nicer looking
	  for RGBA.

2006-08-31 19:36  cclepper

	* changed drawing to use SetVertex() which allows for texturing
	  from texture units other than 0

2006-08-31 18:48  cclepper

	* added texunit message and handling of multiple texture units

2006-08-29 15:34  zmoelnig

	* added "cvs" to the version string

2006-08-29 14:46  zmoelnig

	* removed the tailing slash from BUILDDIR (avoid double-slashes in
	  paths)

2006-08-29 07:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed compilation issue on systems without HAVE_DIRECTSHOW

2006-08-24 21:20  cclepper

	* added HAVE_DIRECTSHOW define to select filmDS or filmAVI

2006-08-24 21:15  cclepper

	* changed defines to add HAVE_DIRECTSHOW

2006-08-24 20:55  cclepper

2006-08-22 12:05  zmoelnig

	* replaced [v+] and friends with pd-objects

2006-08-22 12:03  zmoelnig

	* dummy objects that print an error when being instantiated,
	  telling the user that the real objects ceased to exist

2006-08-22 11:52  zmoelnig

	* cyrille's stencil buffer patch

2006-08-22 07:52  zmoelnig

	* newline at end of file (after all, C++ MUST have a newline at the
	  EOF)

2006-08-22 07:40  zmoelnig

	* put the DirectShow code into #ifdef's to prevent it from bulding
	  on other platforms;
	  dos2unix

2006-08-21 21:21  cclepper

	* Changed callback to GetCurrentBuffer. Added method to record
	  video to disk in native format (useful for DV capture).

2006-08-21 21:16  cclepper

	* Object for loading DirectShow files on Windows

2006-08-21 18:48  cclepper

	* fixed cast to GLclampd for depth flag

	  object always has its own texture

2006-08-17 11:07  zmoelnig

	* added a second inlet for setting a "remote" texture, which is
	  used optionally if no image is present

2006-08-17 09:13  zmoelnig

	* deleted commented out leftovers;
	  use window-dimensions when given dimensions <=0 (instead of <0)

2006-08-17 08:22  zmoelnig

	* an example on how to use full-screen motion-bluring with
	  feedback-textures

	* better(?) declarations of exceptions...

2006-08-14 15:32  zmoelnig

	* removed debugging printout

2006-08-14 15:31  zmoelnig

	* initialization of treeidmap

2006-08-14 15:07  zmoelnig

	* more arguments to objects that need it

2006-08-14 14:58  zmoelnig

	* allow arguments to objects

2006-08-14 14:37  zmoelnig

	* changed this object to A_GIMME,
	  since default args do not like symbols to come after floats...
	  LATER: this object should refuse from being created, if the
	  arguments do not match what we expect
	  LATER: there are other objects who also suffer from this...

2006-08-09 17:15  zmoelnig

	* rearranged a bit, so that it is possible to find the "--with-pd"
	  flag in the help...

2006-08-09 17:08  zmoelnig

	* this might work on os-x!
	  changed the behaviour of "--with-pd" so that it's argument should
	  direct to the base-path of pd, where we can find both headers
	  (<pdpath>/src) and libraries (<pdpath>/bin)

2006-08-09 16:44  zmoelnig

	* use "0" instead of NULL for setting characters

2006-08-09 16:40  zmoelnig

	* protect the inclusion of <colormodels.h> with
	  HAVE_QUICKTIME4LINUX

2006-07-27 16:00  zmoelnig

	* use "vera.ttf" as default font (whoa, this could break things!)

2006-07-27 15:59  zmoelnig

	* use GemState->reset() instead of resetting things manually

2006-07-27 15:58  zmoelnig

	* removed the "stereo" membervariable: this is handled by
	  "tickTime";
	  added a "reset()" method (to be used in [gemhead] instead of
	  resetting things manually)

2006-07-27 15:56  zmoelnig

	* replaced setting GemState->stereo by setting GemState->tickTime;

2006-07-27 12:12  zmoelnig

	* removed an unconditional exception thrown in the constructor

2006-07-25 16:37  zmoelnig

	* use "state->tickTime" instead of "state->stereo" for (not)
	  updating movements

2006-07-25 14:47  zmoelnig

	* made the warning go away. a bit more text...

2006-07-20 18:45  tigital

	* removed "GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT" from
	  fbo status checking because it has been removed from the spec

2006-07-20 17:09  tigital

	* add info about compat message

2006-07-12 04:47  tigital

	* replaced "colorspace" with separate "type" and "format" messages
	  (also can affect creation args): default type=GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
	  and format=GL_RGB; more informative (and more gem-like) error
	  reporting; better setup of fbo's; switchable textureType
	  (default=GL_TEXTURE_2D); better cleanup

2006-07-12 04:26  tigital

	* [osx] "type = ..._REV" or not: compile-time check for
	  __BIG_ENDIAN__, to help support intel-macs

2006-07-12 04:22  tigital

	* [osx] start of code to detect altivec at runtime

2006-07-12 04:21  tigital

	* [osx] possibility of using generic float (software) renderer:
	  should come up with a way to switch between renderer's at runtime

2006-07-12 04:19  tigital

	* [osx] check for resource's existence before releasing them

2006-07-12 04:17  tigital

	* added glTexParameteri()'s; removed auto texcoord generation (for
	  now...); better support for older GL's; seems to work (atm) with
	  geo's

2006-07-12 04:04  tigital

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally)
	  - accepts tables in this order atm: vertex, color, normal,
	  texcoord

2006-07-12 04:00  tigital

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally)

2006-07-12 02:58  tigital

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally)

2006-07-04 14:48  zmoelnig

	* use setCSizeByFormat()

2006-07-04 14:47  zmoelnig

	* use a define for the debug-printout at decoder-instantiation:
	  makes code much more readable

2006-07-04 14:46  zmoelnig

	* the convert(To|From) routines now also work without an explicit
	  colorspace; if none is given, the already set cs of the
	  destination is taken; if this is unset, the default cs is used

2006-07-03 09:06  zmoelnig

	* replaced sprintf() by snprintf(); replaced printf() by
	  post()/error()

2006-07-03 08:45  zmoelnig

	* lowered the threshold of insecurity by replacing usleep() with
	  select()

2006-07-03 08:44  zmoelnig

	* lowered the threshold of insecurity with snprintf(), select(),...

2006-06-26 02:28  tigital

	* xcode 2.3 project file, makes dynamiclib

2006-06-20 09:03  zmoelnig

	* forgot to remove the debugging "read"s...

2006-06-14 10:20  zmoelnig

	* generated from configure.ac

2006-06-14 10:20  zmoelnig

	* the SIMD-tests are only done if required explicitely by the user
	  (e.g. --enable-mmx) or the compiling hardware seems to support it
	  (naive test: if ARCH="i686" we want "sse2" and "mmx" but not
	  "altivec" and the like); LATER make better tests (query processor
	  capabilities)

2006-06-14 10:17  zmoelnig

	* generated from acinclude.m4 (with automake-1.9)

2006-06-14 10:16  zmoelnig

	* the GEM_ARG_WITH macro family now doesn't explicitely set the
	  default value, unless a 3rd argument is given and a non-empty
	  string (like "force")

2006-06-14 09:25  zmoelnig

	* why...these files should have been deleted a long time ago...

2006-06-14 09:02  zmoelnig

	* removed non-free fonts and added one free replacement; added a
	  COPYING.txt which discusses licensing.
	  LATER think about changing the default font to "vera.ttf"

2006-06-14 08:56  zmoelnig

	* oops, forgot to check in the changes for fain-grained control
	  over SIMD-optimization

2006-06-13 22:45  cclepper

	* commented out the fps post() on the Mac since that goes out the
	  outlet

2006-06-13 22:41  cclepper

	* used #if 0 to remove the object from the build process. need to
	  use some proper defines until the new version works as well as
	  the old

2006-06-13 22:31  cclepper

	* should work for Mac/Win now

2006-06-13 22:30  cclepper

	* moved m_recordStart and m_recordStop to the base class. commented
	  out the not implemented getCodecName and getCodecDescription

2006-06-13 22:28  cclepper

	* moved m_recordStart and m_recordStop to the base class

2006-06-13 22:25  cclepper

	* Used one #ifdef to keep from crashing on Mac/Win. m_automatic is
	  now true by default.

2006-06-13 21:31  cclepper

	* Added a very clever #if 0 to remove this file from compilation.

2006-06-13 21:29  cclepper

	* updated header file for volume function

2006-06-09 19:07  cclepper

	* changed maxStackDepth declarations to match. both are GLint

2006-06-09 19:05  cclepper

	* updated header file for quality function

2006-06-09 19:04  cclepper

	* updated header file for volume function

2006-06-09 13:06  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up setCSizeByFormat() to only one big (#ifdef __APPLE__
	  #else) instead of 6 of them: should be more readable

2006-06-08 15:36  zmoelnig

	* clean up shared memory needed when the segment already exists but
	  is smaller than what we requested

2006-06-08 11:55  zmoelnig

	* removed freeShm() from the destructor since the parent's
	  destructor already handles this: the joys of inheritance

2006-06-01 13:58  zmoelnig

	* prefixed V4L2-specific defines with V42L_; added loads of
	  debugging stuff but still couldn't make it work...

2006-06-01 13:55  zmoelnig

	* prefixed V4L-specific defines with V4L_; better checks on
	  stopTransfer()

2006-06-01 13:52  zmoelnig

	* added some more tests for defines when we are on w32

2006-05-31 14:05  zmoelnig

	* reschedule a rendering-cycle when changing the framerate from 0.0
	  to something valid (normally the framerate change only takes
	  effect at the next render-cycle; with framerate==0.0 this can
	  take a long time)

2006-05-31 14:05  zmoelnig

	* cancel pending destroy-requests on "create"

2006-05-31 13:54  zmoelnig

	* reschedule a rendering-cycle when changing the framerate from 0.0
	  to something valid (normally the framerate change only takes
	  effect at the next render-cycle; with framerate==0.0 this can
	  take a long time)

2006-05-24 17:18  cclepper

	* added defines for Intel.

2006-05-24 17:17  cclepper

	* added defines for Intel. fixed stupid looping bug.

2006-05-16 12:00  zmoelnig

	* changed the return type of string.find() from (size_t) to
	  (unsigned long) in order to make a valid test for (pos<0): this
	  prevents hanging...

2006-05-07 10:04  zmoelnig

	* use (size_t) where appropriate

2006-05-07 10:03  zmoelnig

	* made m_size of type (size_t) instead of just (int)

2006-05-07 10:03  zmoelnig

	* include <stdio.h>

2006-05-07 10:00  zmoelnig

	* explicit casts to (float) to shut up warnings

2006-05-04 19:04  zmoelnig

	* respect m_size (via glScale() and glPush/glPop)

2006-05-04 18:54  zmoelnig

	* use GemMan::destroyWindowSoon() for window destruction: this
	  allows to directly connect [gemmouse] to [destroy( without
	  crashing (previously a [del 0] was needed to decouple the
	  window-event-grabbing from the window-destruction)

2006-05-04 18:52  zmoelnig

	* added a destroyWindowSoon() function that issues a delayed
	  windows destruction (destruction is done at the beginning of the
	  next render cycle which is rescheduled to be within 0.0 ms); this
	  is useful when the destruction is initiated via window-events
	  which would otherwise crash pd

2006-05-04 17:53  zmoelnig

	* the slice-input now also accepts a pair of numbers for different
	  numSlices and numStacks; currently only used by [sphere3d]

2006-05-04 17:43  zmoelnig

	* added a spherical object for deformation (similar to [curve3d],
	  but only control-points for now

2006-05-03 13:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed memory-leak

2006-05-03 04:24  tigital

	* now we correctly get the location of uniform variables: how it
	  worked before, I have no idea...

2006-04-28 14:34  zmoelnig

	* use memset() instead of bzero();
	  use __WIN32__ instead of WIN32; include config.h for this to work

2006-04-28 14:33  zmoelnig

	* inlcude config.h for __WIN32__

2006-04-28 14:18  zmoelnig

	* include <io.h> instead of <unistd.h> on w32

2006-04-28 14:16  zmoelnig

	* just include CPPExtern.h: this will include m_pd.h, so we don't
	  need to do it here

2006-04-28 14:13  zmoelnig

	* include GemExportDef before m_pd.h: this way we only have to
	  pragma-disable the vc-warnings once: less code cluttering!

2006-04-28 14:12  zmoelnig

	* use _MSC_VER instead of __WIN32__ for w32-specific things (the
	  used pragmas are vc-only; i am not that sure about the
	  declspec()-things)

2006-04-28 13:57  zmoelnig

	* moved all includes to top of the file;
	  use GemGL.h to include the gl-headers

2006-04-28 13:51  zmoelnig

	* added wglext.h for w32;
	  shouldn't the agl-headers be included here too?

2006-04-28 13:35  zmoelnig

	* automatically define __WIN32__ if _MSC_VER is defined

2006-04-28 13:33  zmoelnig

	* removed test for GL_WIN32_MEAN_AND_LEAN (there is no such thing)

2006-04-28 13:32  zmoelnig

	* use "#ifdef __WIN32__" instead of "#if __WIN32__"

2006-04-28 13:30  zmoelnig

	* protected the use of defines via #ifdef;
	  better bracketing;

2006-04-28 13:29  zmoelnig

	* don't use freeShm() on __WIN32__

2006-04-28 13:29  zmoelnig

	* protected the use of defines via #ifdef

2006-04-28 13:27  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_QUICKTIME (and added a not about where it should be
	  defined properly)

2006-04-28 13:26  zmoelnig

	* use double for sqrt()

2006-04-28 13:24  zmoelnig

	* on w32 include <io.h> instead of <unistd.h>

2006-04-28 13:22  zmoelnig

	* check if GL_TEXTURE0_ARB is defined before using it

2006-04-27 12:35  zmoelnig

	* it has been a long time since i compiled that...fixed some minor
	  typos...

2006-04-27 12:07  zmoelnig

	* added checks for video4linux-2; this is disabled by default
	  (enable it with
	  "--with-v4l2")

2006-04-27 11:21  zmoelnig

	* added the bug reported by cyrille regarding pix_video and philips
	  webcams

2006-04-26 15:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed the [vertex_program]-bug; opened the freeframe-64bit issue

2006-04-26 15:34  zmoelnig

	* made "param" an alias for "parameter", since this is the keyword
	  most objects use...

2006-04-26 15:33  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug where m_envNum was not properly initialized when
	  [vertex_program] was called with an argument; moved "parameter"
	  to vertex_program.cpp, so both objects can set the parameter;
	  LATER think about multiple parameters...

2006-04-26 12:22  zmoelnig

	* proper initialization prevents crashes in destructor...

2006-04-26 09:35  zmoelnig

	* did some proper initializing of pointers to prevent crashes
	  (why has nobody thought about that in the generation process!??)

2006-04-26 08:30  zmoelnig

	* trigger the quitting from outside (that is: the script)

2006-04-26 08:20  zmoelnig

	* a simple test that tests for all Gem objects (as listed in
	  objects.txt);
	  no tests are performed on vertex/-objects and on markEx/-objects

2006-04-26 07:47  zmoelnig

	* fixed the [separator] bug;
	  found other ways to trigger the [vertex_program] bug

2006-04-26 07:41  zmoelnig

	* before pushing to the stacks, check whether the stacks are
	  already full;
	  this leads to less errors when chaining more than 1 [separator]

2006-04-26 07:40  zmoelnig

	* added a variable for the current depth of the matrix-stacks

2006-04-26 07:39  zmoelnig

	* query the number of supported stacks for the various matrix-modes
	  (important
	  for [separator];
	  text whether GL_NV_multisample_texture_hint is supported before
	  setting the hint;

2006-04-25 17:18  zmoelnig

	* normalized input and output values; still no clamping

2006-04-25 16:58  zmoelnig

	* yuv2rgb and vice versa conversion abstractions

2006-04-24 19:16  zmoelnig

	* use "size_t" for alignment-magic, since
	  sizeof(int)!=sizeof(unsigned char*) on x86_64;
	  btw, this should be used in pd's m_simd.h and in the freeframe
	  specs too...

2006-04-11 09:33  zmoelnig

	* moved the window-destruction in render() before the m_windowState
	  check: this fixes issues with lights when destroying the windows
	  from "outside"

2006-04-07 15:12  tigital

	* [osx] uyvy/bgra/yv12 conversions altivec'd (DONE)

2006-04-07 03:49  tigital

	* yuv422_to_bgra_altivec() now works; fixed some typos;
	  re-corrected #include's

2006-04-05 11:29  zmoelnig

	* removed this pseudo-configure script since it is totally
	  outdated;
	  the (pseudo) Makefile in here should call configure in src/ if
	  needed

2006-04-05 11:27  zmoelnig

	* removed the call to glClearColor() in the reset()-routine since
	  it might crash pd/Gem when no valid context is available (LATER:
	  think what will happen when someone clicks on "reset" while
	  rendering)

2006-03-28 09:40  zmoelnig

	* reverted the include-change by jamie.
	  this should really be handled by configure and NOT in here since
	  we don't
	  know whether the quicktime-headers are in lqt/ or quicktime/
	  or...

2006-03-28 03:20  tigital

	* fixed header inclusion

2006-03-27 16:46  tigital

	* CLAMP() is inlined from GemFuncUtil.h

2006-03-27 14:48  zmoelnig

	* replaced "nil" by "null64" in MMX routines, since this makes
	  problems with QuickTime-framework (on macintel)

2006-03-27 14:47  zmoelnig

	* added SSE2 processing for YUV (but most of the time is spent in
	  memory-fetching anyhow, so not much of a speed gain)

2006-03-27 07:52  zmoelnig

	* updated TODO-list: opened new bugs for [separator], missing
	  objects on w32, and the shader-objects

2006-03-24 15:16  zmoelnig

	* initialize (and modify) m_simd via GemSIMD and select optimized
	  algorithms at runtime.

2006-03-24 15:12  zmoelnig

	* instantiate a GemSIMD class in order to query the CPU only once.

2006-03-24 15:10  zmoelnig

	* implemented a small static class GemSIMD which is used to query
	  the SIMD-capabilities of the current CPUs: this should bring us
	  away from (not) using SIMD via preprocessors.

2006-03-23 23:08  zmoelnig

	* weird: compiling with SSE2 (on a system that doesn't support
	  it!), yields
	  to crashes when casting "double" to "int"; using "float" works
	  fine, so i
	  enforced floats here...

2006-03-23 22:51  zmoelnig

	* removed "done..." printout in destructor

2006-03-23 17:07  zmoelnig

	* added check for sse2

2006-03-23 17:05  zmoelnig

	* added YUV->RGB24 routine (its not really faster than YUV->RGB32)

2006-03-23 17:03  zmoelnig

	* put GEM_VECTORALIGNMENT in here

2006-03-23 14:25  zmoelnig

	* further improved the SSE2-code: less shuffling done (in YUV2RGBA)
	  and cache optimization on writing

2006-03-23 14:07  zmoelnig

	* use macros for the timing code: this makes things much more
	  readable (no more ifdef's within the actual code to time)

2006-03-22 23:07  tigital

	* typo with no effect

2006-03-22 23:06  tigital

	* var initializing re-ordering

2006-03-22 22:50  tigital

	* added "#ifdef GL_ARB_shader_objects" to linkCallback()

2006-03-22 22:47  tigital

	* added YUV422_to_YV12_altivec(); changed function var's to
	  YV12_to_YUV422_altivec() so it works in the new file; started
	  YUV422_to_BGRA_altivec(), but non-functioning atm

2006-03-22 22:43  tigital

	* re-ordering

2006-03-22 22:40  tigital

	* GemPixConvert.h switcheroo

2006-03-22 17:41  zmoelnig

	* use the YUV2RGBA routines;
	  on reallocate() make sure that a pointer to the aligned memory is
	  returned

2006-03-22 17:35  zmoelnig

	* initial SSE2-optimized YUV2RGBA conversion: there is still a lot
	  to be done here (e.g. get a real grip on SIMD-programming!)

2006-03-22 12:59  zmoelnig

	* added SSE2-optimized RGBA2YUV conversion;
	  since GemPixUtil.cpp has grownso huge, i have outsourced the
	  optimized color conversion routines into separate files
	  GemPixConvertAltivec.cpp, GemPixConvertSSE2.cpp; obviously this
	  has only been tested on linux and mightwork (or not) on osx

2006-03-20 21:32  zmoelnig

	* did i check this in already?

2006-03-20 20:53  zmoelnig

	* a toon-shader done with glsl

2006-03-20 15:02  tigital

	* "#ifdef GL_ARB_shader_objects" added to createArrays()

2006-03-19 18:25  zmoelnig

	* i think the separator-issue is almost fixed

2006-03-19 18:25  tigital

	* remembered to member variables (masses, springs), so now we have
	  actual object autonomy

2006-03-18 20:36  tigital

	* fixed typo, now compiles

2006-03-18 14:21  zmoelnig

	* in theory these changes should fix the memleak problem with the
	  [separator]: while i was extra careful, i hope that my changes
	  will be compiling and (what's more) be functional on other
	  platforms!

2006-03-16 09:34  zmoelnig

	* updated help-patches (mostly xchanged the [destroy( message with
	  [create()

2006-03-16 08:55  zmoelnig

	* FIXED: not using client-storage on machines that do not support
	  it led to a "invalid enumerant" GL-error (due to setting
	  GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE via glPixelStore to _some_ value);

2006-03-15 19:49  tigital

	* updated based on what was committed yesterday, plus some other
	  things

2006-03-15 17:09  zmoelnig

	* updated since a help-patch for [pix_record] is now available

2006-03-15 16:51  zmoelnig

	* new implementation that allows switching of the attached
	  shm-segment via a "set" message.

2006-03-15 15:42  zmoelnig

	* things removed for osX needed to be removed on linux too

2006-03-15 10:37  zmoelnig

	* a help-patch

2006-03-15 10:35  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit (less verbosity; local variables should not be
	  called m_...; ...)

2006-03-14 20:04  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()...also initial code
	  (not fully working) intended to allow auto-texcoord generation
	  and setTexCoords()

2006-03-14 19:59  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()...also changed to
	  GL_NEAREST filtering to prevent fallback to software
	  renderer...and initial (not fully working) code to allow
	  colorspace request (ie. FLOAT, RGB, RGBA)

2006-03-14 19:53  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 19:25  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 19:18  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 18:23  tigital

	* corrected path to initial image

2006-03-14 15:35  zmoelnig

	* glsl_vertex and glsl_fragment now respect pd's search path;
	  updated TODO since some help-patches are now done

2006-03-14 15:32  zmoelnig

	* updated and new help-patches for shaders

2006-03-14 14:25  tigital

	* [size $1< works, and it's centered; removed CLIP_* limitations,
	  so now it's like a normal gem object; some cleanup

2006-03-14 14:20  tigital

	* added setModified() to parmMess: where is this really necessary
	  (and not)?

2006-03-14 14:19  zmoelnig

	* link now optionally takes a list of module-id's: [link 3 2( is
	  the same as [shader 3 2, link(

2006-03-14 14:17  zmoelnig

	* repsect pd's search path when opening shaders;
	  fewer openGL errors;

2006-03-14 14:17  tigital

	* cleanup: removed unused function bindTexture()

2006-03-14 13:20  zmoelnig

	* removed printout of plugin address; made param# larger and end
	  the param-string with \0

2006-03-14 13:18  zmoelnig

	* added help-files for ARB shaders; made the [pix_freeframe] object
	  theoretically
	  functional

2006-03-14 12:33  zmoelnig

	* empty(!still!) class for a splash screen;
	  this object is aliased "Gem", so that when people create a [Gem]
	  object, it doesn't fail

2006-03-14 10:40  zmoelnig

	* mark shm-segment for deletion when object is destroyed;
	  [TODO]: marked pix_share_* as done

2006-03-14 10:38  zmoelnig

	* added help patches

2006-03-14 10:14  zmoelnig

	* made it work on linux (even without crashes!);
	  now you can also specify the 4th argument (color) as symbolic
	  name like "RGBA" or "YUV":

2006-03-14 08:58  zmoelnig

	* updated status

2006-03-14 08:53  zmoelnig

	* what we still have to-do to make the gem-0.91 release

2006-03-13 20:27  zmoelnig

	* added a handle for Destroy-Event on linux; whenever the window is
	  closed (by clicking on the "x") the gem-context will be
	  destroyed;
	  this needs to be done outside of the event-loop to avoid crashes

2006-03-13 19:38  zmoelnig

	* convert from cs other than RGBA

2006-03-13 17:47  zmoelnig

	* registered the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol in order to disable the
	  user-closing of the Window: LATER think about closing the window,
	  when the user requests it.

2006-03-13 17:20  zmoelnig

	* respect the upside-down flag when in mem2jpegImage(): however on
	  my machine
	  the images written seem to be correct anyhow...

2006-03-13 16:56  zmoelnig

	* do not instantiate recordQT4L when HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACK is
	  not defined

2006-03-12 20:37  zmoelnig

	* added help-patches for the hsv2rgb (and vice versa) abstraction:
	  these are just copies from Gem/help/

2006-03-12 20:34  zmoelnig

	* new abstractions in case we get rid of MarkEx

2006-03-12 19:33  zmoelnig

	* added new help-file

2006-03-12 19:07  zmoelnig

	* new help-files

2006-03-06 11:23  zmoelnig

	* added stencil-buffer for glx (tested) and wgl (NOT tested)

2006-03-04 00:52  tigital

	* added stencil buffer on creation

2006-03-03 20:42  tigital

	* added env message; cleanups in setUpTextureState()

2006-03-02 14:55  zmoelnig

	* set "upsidedown" to false: while this is the default on most
	  systems, it is not on OSX (where quicktime makes flipped images);
	  however pix_snap will always make "upright" images, so we have to
	  make sure this is set here; this should close #1096651 at the
	  sf-tracker (but i haven't tested it on OSX)
	  additionally use setCsizeByFormat();
	  additionally enable the __APPLE__'ed code for all platforms (its
	  nothing apple-specific in there)

2006-02-28 17:40  zmoelnig

	* who need m_name and m_length ? not me...

2006-02-28 17:39  zmoelnig

	* whoa! finally found the bug that made Gem crash on re-loading a
	  shader (or loading another one...); lots of cleanups, like using
	  C++ "new" instead of "malloc" and more terse output and and ...

2006-02-27 16:00  tigital

	* free arrays in getVariables() before getting the new
	  m_uniformCount

2006-02-27 15:09  zmoelnig

	* finally found the type that made a) the object crash and b) it
	  look weird;
	  only regenerate the vertices,... when needed (e.g. something has
	  changed)

2006-02-27 14:25  zmoelnig

	* added better (probably working) tests for ARB and NV extensions

2006-02-27 14:09  zmoelnig

	* added a better (probably working) test for "lqt_add_video_track"

2006-02-27 13:36  zmoelnig

	* added missing curly bracket

2006-02-27 13:35  zmoelnig

	* initialized the index-array to "0": this keeps us from crashing!

2006-02-24 15:14  tigital

	* added messages: "drag"(default 0.5) and "spring" (default 0.3);
	  some cleanup

2006-02-23 17:34  zmoelnig

	* added support for writing specified slots to disk (not very well
	  tested)

2006-02-23 17:33  zmoelnig

	* support for other colorspaces than RGB when writing with
	  imagemagick (YUV not yet supported; libtiff and libjpeg not
	  tested at all!)

2006-02-23 15:33  zmoelnig

	* only compile if HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACKS is defined (which
	  should be defined by configure)

2006-02-23 15:29  zmoelnig

	* removed the inlet

2006-02-23 15:29  zmoelnig

	* allow to set the class-flags by defining GEM_CLASSFLAGS

2006-02-21 14:01  zmoelnig

	* define HAVE_CONFIG_GENERIC_H if we don't have another
	  config*.h.in file

2006-02-21 14:00  zmoelnig

	* include configGeneric.h instead of os-specific config-file if
	  HAVE_CONFIG_GENERIC_H is defined (at the command line)

2006-02-21 13:27  zmoelnig

	* a generic fallback (a la long we can replace all the os-specific
	  config.h.in files)

2006-02-21 13:25  zmoelnig

	* added a test for lqt_add_video_track()

2006-02-21 13:01  zmoelnig

	* added HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACK, since older versions of
	  libquicktime don't have this...

2006-02-21 11:05  zmoelnig

	* tried to make it more stable;
	  it is till crashing when: a) switching from non-texture to
	  texture (it works when the texture is present when rendering is
	  started); b) switching the lighting-state

2006-02-21 11:02  zmoelnig

	* #ifdef'ed everything with USE_GLEW (currently glew is not used,
	  so try to avoid any interference)

2006-02-17 05:22  tigital

	* removed an unused outlet

2006-02-16 19:53  tigital

	* useful for automatic texture-coordinate generation

2006-02-15 23:05  tigital

	* [osx] one last hack to make it work like the other platforms

2006-02-15 20:54  zmoelnig

	* oops! for testing i used __linux__ instead of __APPLE__ and
	  forgot to revert it...

2006-02-15 20:34  zmoelnig

	* some string magic to get the correct name of the plugin within an
	  osX-bundle

2006-02-15 18:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed use of DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDEQUATION (it was used as
	  HAVE_GLBLENDEQUATION)

2006-02-13 21:49  zmoelnig

	* removed the 2nd inlet (why was it there at all?)

2006-02-13 16:58  tigital

	* corrected all.trees path to work from help

2006-02-10 15:20  zmoelnig

	* use MAKECMDGOALS when calling the Makefile in src/

2006-02-10 13:32  zmoelnig

	* added inlets for contrast and saturation

2006-02-10 13:26  zmoelnig

	* added Grayscale processing
	  avoid processing in [pix_contrast] if both m_contrast and
	  m_saturate are 1.f (in greyscale ignore m_saturate)

2006-02-09 00:32  tigital

	* [osx] new loader code that works with freeframe 1.0 SDK; note
	  that the plugin will be looked for in the same directory as the
	  patch, and currently you must append ".frf" to the end of the
	  plugin's name

2006-02-08 22:39  tigital

	* cleaned up imageStruct::setCsizeByFormat() so that it no longer
	  does "default" switch before hitting the various case's

2006-02-08 22:27  cclepper

	* Added RGBA version and tested on Windows.

2006-02-08 22:26  cclepper

	* Added RGBA version and tested on Windows. Works except for
	  negative contrasrt and saturarion values.

2006-02-07 16:16  zmoelnig

	* renamed processYUV_Altivec() to processYUVAltivec() so it gets
	  automatically called by GemPixObj's render();
	  put initializing of class-variables into the constructor-header

2006-02-07 03:34  cclepper

	* added #ifdef __VEC__

2006-02-06 21:47  cclepper

	* initial YUV version with Altivec

2006-02-06 17:20  cclepper

	* brings the old pix_record up to date

2006-02-06 14:14  zmoelnig

	* implemented the setCodec(int) as a no-op

2006-02-06 13:41  zmoelnig

	* better indentation to see what is included when

2006-02-06 10:15  zmoelnig

	* this is the original pix_record, now renamed to pix_recordQT
	  while we have the two concurrent objects, how should we make this
	  compatible? create an abstraction?? make hacks like in
	  [pix_filmNT]???

2006-02-06 09:58  zmoelnig

	* at least made it compile on os-x

2006-02-05 19:23  zmoelnig

	* made "record"-message work again

2006-02-05 19:22  zmoelnig

	* now it produces something...

2006-02-05 18:51  zmoelnig

	* updated to use lqt-api instead of old quicktime4linux api.
	  although it somehow produces just noise right now (but hey - it
	  did work 10 minutes ago)

2006-02-05 18:49  zmoelnig

	* removed the dummy implementation of putFrame(): it is pure
	  virtual in record.cpp and should not be filled with dummies

2006-02-04 18:16  tigital

	* update

2006-02-04 12:47  zmoelnig

	* define HAVE_QUICKTIME for __APPLE__
	  (later think about using autoconf for this)

2006-02-04 12:44  zmoelnig

	* added convertTo() and convertFrom() functions to the
	  imageStruct-class for generic cs-conversion.

2006-02-03 21:53  zmoelnig

	* pix_record which is independent of the used API (like
	  pix_filmNEW,...)

2006-02-03 21:52  zmoelnig

	* blind fixes to match record.h

2006-02-03 21:40  zmoelnig

	* implementation classes for pix-record APIs.
	  so far the recordQT4L (quicktime-for-linux) is tested, but not
	  totally stable
	  the recordQT (Apple's QuickTime API) has been copy'n'pasted from
	  the original pix_record.cpp code - i am pretty sure i introduced
	  some problems: at least the codec-querying and (more important)
	  setting has certainly been broken.

2006-02-03 15:33  tigital

	* [osx]: shutup gcc warning in initGem()

2006-02-01 18:38  zmoelnig

	* replaced printf() by error() (it's more pdish and doesn't throw
	  an error)

2006-02-01 18:37  zmoelnig

	* at least it compiles here on linux...

2006-02-01 18:21  zmoelnig

	* probably a new-line at EOF

2006-02-01 18:21  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up code a bit (so i can read it :-))
	  should perform a bit faster as well
	  fixed a crash on my machine
	  added type message
	  
	  still very crashy
	  i _think_ there is a bug (most likely: a memory leak) in here

2006-02-01 16:53  tigital

	* forgot header change to other platforms: this'll be cleaned and
	  put in the correct spot (ie. the top of the file) sometime

2006-02-01 15:43  tigital

	* initial commit: novel mathematical structure

2006-02-01 15:42  tigital

	* initial commit: takes an image and creates a "voronoi region"
	  painting out of it...works on OSX, but relies on GemPBuffer code,
	  so other platforms can use this to test that code...

2006-02-01 15:39  tigital

	* initial commit: works on OSX (still needs some serious cleanup!),
	  but untested on other platforms: code is there, but is it really
	  equivalently functional?

2006-02-01 15:37  tigital

	* added check for a loaded program to the paramMess code; prevents
	  crashing when sending parameters to the object but no program is
	  actually loaded!

2006-02-01 15:36  tigital

	* error code reporting cleanup

2006-02-01 15:34  tigital

	* [OSX] changed NULL to 0 to shutup gcc

2006-02-01 15:33  tigital

	* added header for glReportError(); [OSX] added "masterContext"

2006-02-01 15:31  tigital

	* cleanup; added setModified();

2006-02-01 15:04  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__"

2006-02-01 15:03  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__"
	  removed unneccessary headers from inclusion

2006-02-01 15:00  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__"
	  moved the check for glx-support to GemWinCreateXWin.h

2006-02-01 14:58  tigital

	* [OSX] added "masterContext", which gets rid of need for
	  HaveValidContext()...needs non-jamie testing ;-)

2006-02-01 14:53  tigital

	* cleanups; added TODO questions; [OSX] added "masterContext",
	  which gets rid of need for HaveValidContext()...needs non-jamie
	  testing ;-)

2006-02-01 13:24  zmoelnig

	* only create constContext when its not already created

2006-02-01 13:23  zmoelnig

	* applied patch from cesare to avoid crashes on closing the window

2006-01-30 13:12  zmoelnig

	* added constructor for pixBlock-class (which properly initalizes
	  newfilm and newimage to "false")
	  moved constructor/destructor of imageStruct and pixBlock from
	  header into the cpp-files to avoid unneccessary recompilation on
	  changes)

2006-01-26 14:47  zmoelnig

	* made a script (which will hopefully hardly ever be needed) to
	  import glew
	  mention it in the README.glew

2006-01-26 14:07  zmoelnig

	* added glew-files (+ a readme how i got them)

2006-01-23 11:08  zmoelnig

	* changed [part_velsphere] to [part_velocity sphere]

2006-01-23 11:07  zmoelnig

	* define DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDQUATION
	  
	  i think, this file should be used only for M$VC;
	  LATER we can put #pragma's in here to enable linking with special
	  libraries based on the configuration (or should we rather do it
	  in the files that need these libraries??)

2006-01-23 11:05  zmoelnig

	* use a DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDQUATION rather than __WIN32__ to determine
	  whether this objects needs to be disabled

2006-01-22 21:43  zmoelnig

	* added alternative dependencies for magick++6 and avifile-0.7

2006-01-22 21:41  zmoelnig

	* added newly added files

2006-01-22 21:40  zmoelnig

	* minor changes (line.breaks)

2006-01-22 21:37  zmoelnig

	* on w32 we have to include <io.h> to be able to use "close(int)"

2006-01-22 21:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed string-template issues with vc6

2006-01-22 21:29  zmoelnig

	* changed 0.5 to 0.5f to make floats instead of doubles (amd thus
	  reduce warnings about conversion)

2006-01-22 21:27  zmoelnig

	* disabled if GL_TEXTURE0_ARB is undefined
	  (another candidate for GLEW)

2006-01-22 21:26  zmoelnig

	* removed definition of DEBUG=0 since it is not needed anyhow

2006-01-22 21:25  zmoelnig

	* turn glBlendEquation OFF on w32 (stupid restriction, but faster
	  than finding anything more sophisticated)

2006-01-22 21:23  zmoelnig

	* only set glParameterEnvArg if vertexprograms are supported by the
	  headers

2006-01-22 21:17  zmoelnig

	* disable more warnings (here: switch-statement without case (only
	  default); this is possible is all cases are turned off by
	  #ifdefs)
	  
	  NOTE: these pragmas should be within __MSC_VER_ instead of
	  __WIN32__

2006-01-18 12:11  zmoelnig

	* found this lying around on my harddisk

2006-01-18 11:22  zmoelnig

	* made circle::NUM_PTS a define rather than a const static variable

2006-01-18 11:13  zmoelnig

	* removed unused variables
	  made circle::NUM_PTS a define rather than a const static variable

2006-01-18 10:54  zmoelnig

	* set a variable when an apple-framework is found
	  use it in the status-report (so apple-users don't get confused
	  about no QuickTime even if the framework is installed)
	  in "configure" the removal of "local"/"locale" is also applied

2006-01-18 10:52  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo "locale" should read "local"; however, since the tests
	  are not expanded into functions, this does not work
	  so i removed the "locale" entirely and replaced it by a
	  pseudo-localized variable (appending stuff derived from the
	  arguments)

2006-01-18 10:24  zmoelnig

	* properly ifdef the usage of "kDVCPROHD720pCodecType"

2006-01-18 10:18  zmoelnig

	* declare getFPS() (inherited from film.h)

2006-01-18 10:15  zmoelnig

	* include <fcntl.h> for open()

2006-01-18 10:02  zmoelnig

	* disable more code, if GL_ARB_shader_objects is not defined
	  (mostly cosmetic)

2006-01-18 10:00  zmoelnig

	* disable most of the code if "GL_ARB_shader_objects" is not
	  defined

2006-01-18 09:13  zmoelnig

	* avoid using m_program if "GL_ARB_shader_objects" is not defined

2006-01-17 11:01  zmoelnig

	* prevent ARB-GLSL

2005-12-27 19:03  tigital

	* initial helpfile

2005-12-15 17:45  zmoelnig

	* removed loading/saving
	  removed "point" area-type
	  changed (float) to (unsigned char) where possible (at least where
	  it was obvious to do)

2005-12-15 13:09  zmoelnig

	* updated a bit so we can build a debian-package

2005-12-15 12:17  zmoelnig

	* added davide's hit-object

2005-12-15 10:54  zmoelnig

	* initialized more variables
	  moved initialization (from body of constructor) into
	  initialization-block of constructor

2005-12-15 00:43  tigital

	* clean up in render loop

2005-12-14 23:19  cclepper

	* works on windows. sorta. only a few changes needed from the mac
	  code.

2005-12-14 15:53  tigital

	* string buffer is now member variable; more detailed reporting
	  when program is outside hardware limits

2005-12-14 13:34  zmoelnig

	* TreeIdMap for reacTable*'s fiducials

2005-12-14 13:29  zmoelnig

	* dont build depend-files when doing "make clean" or "make
	  distclean"

2005-12-14 13:29  zmoelnig

	* don't try to generate configure, Make.config and the like when
	  doing a "make clean" or "make distclean"

2005-12-14 13:28  zmoelnig

	* newline at end of file...

2005-12-14 13:26  zmoelnig

	* fixed header-inclusion-prevention-defines (ye, my mother-tongue
	  is German)

2005-12-14 13:24  zmoelnig

	* included Ross and Martin for the reacTIVision system
	  replaced "@" by "[AT]"

2005-12-14 13:15  zmoelnig

	* help-patches for the fiducial-tracker (and the binarizing
	  thresholder)

2005-12-14 13:14  zmoelnig

	* fiducial-tracking as used in reacTIVision
	  thanks to martin kaltenbrunner and ross bencina (and the mtg@upf)
	  for releasing their code under (L)GPL

2005-12-14 13:13  zmoelnig

	* binarizing adaptive tiled thresholder

2005-12-14 13:07  zmoelnig

	* better check whether switching to another driver succeeds

2005-12-10 19:45  tigital

	* added glReportError() for helping debug

2005-12-10 18:40  zmoelnig

	* moved GLdefine's from GemPixUtil to GemGL

2005-12-10 16:01  tigital

	* corrected spotlight direction initialization; placed limits on
	  light parameters (as supported by GL)

2005-12-10 00:20  tigital

	* removed spurious glEnd() called in createSphere: it was causing a
	  glError...

2005-12-09 22:52  cclepper

	* added parameter message

2005-12-07 16:40  cclepper

	* fixed QT crashing on Windows, but the fix introduces a small
	  memory leak when loading new movies. Also, removed a redundant
	  memcpy() in getFrame.

2005-12-07 16:17  tigital

	* - added mode & repeat messages (like [pix_texture], same
	  defaults)
	  - added outlet for texture info: ID, width, height, type

2005-12-06 06:40  tigital

	* initial commit:
	  - allows offscreen rendering on a per [gemhead] basis
	  - defaults to 256x256, but can be set with [dimen x y<
	  - float RGB only, atm
	  - right outlet outputs list: texID, width, height, type
	  - type can be switched with [mode 0/1< (ie. TEXTURE_2D or
	  TEXTURE_RECTANGLE)

2005-12-06 05:56  tigital

	* renamed inlet for some unknown reason

2005-12-06 04:01  tigital

	* don't need to enable/disable shader_arb; added check and better
	  clean up for re-loaded shaders

2005-12-04 22:45  tigital

	* added outlet for programID

2005-12-04 16:15  tigital

	* useful glWrapper which allows one to use a glsl_program that was
	  linked in an earlier chain in a later chain; but don't forget to
	  frame it's usage with an ending call with value zero, or the
	  program affects all later chains

2005-12-04 01:17  tigital

	* individual shader objects are now responsible for cleaning up
	  after themselves; also, made initialized length=0

2005-12-04 01:13  tigital

	* object is now responsible for cleaning up after itself; also
	  discovered that we don't need to glEnable the *_SHADER_ARB's

2005-11-30 06:55  tigital

	* auto-magic uniform variable discovery working; shaderMess()
	  fixes; lotsa cleanup in general (& stuff)

2005-11-30 00:12  tigital

	* clean-up, & better initialization

2005-11-29 23:55  tigital

	* corrected shaderMess behavior; added OSX check for
	  hardware/software execution

2005-11-29 04:52  tigital

	* miscellaneous fixes of warnings, misspellings, and debug messages

2005-11-28 23:29  cclepper

	* added SequenceGrabber recording

2005-11-27 14:30  zmoelnig

	* thread fixes:
	  + better initializing
	  + more freeing
	  + filenames given as argument are now opened via thread too

2005-11-27 10:24  zmoelnig

	* reduced verbosity a bit
	  made rest of error messages a bit more findable ("error:
	  GemImageLoad" instead of just "erro: GEM")

2005-11-26 21:17  zmoelnig

	* added dynamic methods for uniform parameters

2005-11-26 19:13  cclepper

	* Added the first check for HD format clips to deal with their
	  trickster frame sizes. Also, a fix for sound continuing after
	  rendering stops.

2005-11-26 16:19  zmoelnig

	* use a #define for defining the max number of shaders
	  fixed some typos and minor bugs

2005-11-26 15:36  zmoelnig

	* on creating the child-thread wait until it has set the
	  m_thread_running (so we can use that in openMess())

2005-11-26 13:12  zmoelnig

	* reduced verbosity

2005-11-26 12:48  zmoelnig

	* hmm: define "t_GLshaderObj" to whatever type the shaderobj should
	  be;
	  made it compile on linux (and not crash)

2005-11-26 12:45  zmoelnig

	* include stdlib (for malloc, free)
	  replace printf() by post()

2005-11-26 05:08  cclepper

	* Added the first check for HD format clips to deal with their
	  trickster frame sizes. Also, a fix for sound continuing after
	  rendering stops.

2005-11-26 00:50  tigital

	* initial wrapper support for GLSL support (ARB based):
	  - there should be a whole host of these, but right now I'm only
	  up to writing the one, for input of one indexed float ;-)

2005-11-25 22:56  tigital

	* initial GLSL support (ARB based):
	  - load individual shaders via glsl_vertex or glsl_fragment
	  - combine multiple shader's right output into a [shader $1 $2...<
	  and send into [glsl_program]
	  - send [link< to [glsl_program] to actually link the objects:
	  this was done because we don't want to re-link objects every
	  render-timeslice...
	  - each object accepts a [print< to give info, , and
	  [glsl_program] will also report linked program's uniform
	  variables, names, indices...
	  - uniform variable indices can be used with [GEMglUniform...] to
	  change variables (but maybe there should be more auto-discovery
	  in [glsl_program]?)
	  - object's will also report a shader's compile-time error log (if
	  any) to console (not pd's tk console): need to figure out how to
	  parse infolog into post()-friendly format...

2005-11-23 13:08  zmoelnig

	* added check for GLsizeiptrARB

2005-11-23 13:07  zmoelnig

	* die at the end of configure if no openGL has been found
	  check for typedef of GLsizeiptrARB

2005-11-21 14:31  zmoelnig

	* threaded image loading

2005-11-15 14:24  zmoelnig

	* updated help-files

2005-11-15 14:22  zmoelnig

	* show how to load an image into the buffer

2005-11-15 14:21  zmoelnig

	* added some more wrappers (thanks to cyrille)

2005-11-10 14:50  zmoelnig

	* initialize m_devicename to NULL in order to not produce random
	  crashes.
	  fixed printf() security-hole

2005-11-09 03:08  tigital

	* cleaned up headers, initialization; also added code to pad
	  rowbytes for dimensions not multitples of 16 or 32 (helps
	  GL_STORAGE_SHARED_APPLE)

2005-11-08 23:01  cclepper

	* added a little hack to bang when film reaches the end in auto
	  mode

2005-10-31 16:04  tigital

	* update

2005-10-28 08:59  zmoelnig

	* use proper inheritance for the altivec function

2005-10-27 22:13  tigital

	* added imageStruct.fromGray( short*) version, so now we can import
	  luminance images from pdp2gem...

2005-10-27 21:31  cclepper

	* added Altivec YUV function

2005-10-26 13:54  zmoelnig

	* fixed path and case of images to load

2005-10-25 20:37  cclepper

	* commented out lines in postrender which removes memory leak in
	  [separator]

2005-10-25 10:01  zmoelnig

	* throw an exception when no texture-units are defined at startup
	  time (prevents object-creation)
	  enforce 2 arguments in the texUnit-message

2005-10-25 09:54  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: added A_NULL as terminating argument to the
	  texUnit-callback

2005-10-22 20:50  tigital

	* GL_VERSION_1_1 check only (there's no GL_VERSION_1_0_ on osx!)

2005-10-21 12:49  zmoelnig

	* improved threaded movie-player:
	  use select() instead of usleep() (should be more portable)
	  when the grabThread returns no frame (NULL), a "bang" is emitted
	  at render-time. the user gets a chance to immediately react on
	  that and reset the frame# to something valid.
	  when threaded, this will force the changed frame to be read in
	  the main-thread (luckily the grabthread is locked by the mutex)

2005-10-21 08:55  zmoelnig

	* changes in configure.ac

2005-10-21 08:55  zmoelnig

	* check whether ffmpeg's (AVStream)->codec is of type
	  "AVCodecContext" or "*AVCodecContext"

2005-10-21 08:03  zmoelnig

	* removed contents of src/Gnu (since people keep building Gem from
	  there)

2005-10-20 16:03  zmoelnig

	* check for posix-threads
	  removed HAVE_SIMD things (as we should rather use the __MMX__,...
	  that are autodefined by the compiler)

2005-10-20 16:02  zmoelnig

	* check for posixthreads (as in pd)

2005-10-20 13:41  zmoelnig

	* (optional) threaded reading of movies

2005-10-20 13:38  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings; explicit casts from t_float to GLint

2005-10-20 10:03  zmoelnig

	* added method for "device" with symbolic device-names

2005-10-20 09:59  zmoelnig

	* 2 lines of comment...

2005-10-20 09:53  zmoelnig

	* fixed docu-bug that led people to try to compile Gem from src/Gnu
	  instead of src/

2005-10-19 12:48  tigital

	* initial commit:
	  - accepts a creation arg to set # of texture units to deal with,
	  or it defaults to the maximum # on the card
	  - [texUnit 1 $2< assigns to texture Unit 1 the texID input via $2
	  - [mode 0/1< switches between TEXTURE_RECTANGLE and TEXTURE_2D

2005-10-18 23:59  tigital

	* more GLdefine's for multitexture and combiners...

2005-10-14 07:54  zmoelnig

	* disabled warnings on __WIN32__

2005-10-08 16:24  zmoelnig

	* wow! this file has been unused for quite a long time now; since i
	  cannot find any reference to it anywhere (except in the 1.1.1.1
	  or so revision of papi.h) i delete it.

2005-10-07 17:03  zmoelnig

	* removed the disabling of the entire code when FILM_NEW is defined
	  (oh this is really ugly)

2005-10-07 17:02  zmoelnig

	* enabled the weird hack i made for a current CVS snapshot of
	  ffmpeg, since the debian/sid package now uses the new API

2005-10-07 16:53  zmoelnig

	* remove "-f" (less errors if files are already removed)

2005-10-07 16:52  zmoelnig

	* updated w32 compile environment

2005-10-07 16:51  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-10-07 16:50  zmoelnig

	* only cimpileif we don't want FILM_NEW (i got an error when
	  compiling in the vfw.h file and i didn't want to fix it in a
	  deprecated file); LATER remove these files

2005-10-07 16:49  zmoelnig

	* no shared memory (via shm) on w32; disabled on that platform

2005-10-07 16:47  zmoelnig

	* defined pragmas to make compiler a bit less verbose

2005-10-07 16:47  zmoelnig

	* hacked together a version of drand48(); how comes drand48() does
	  not exist on w32 even though these files are in here for years ?
	  (LATER)

2005-10-07 16:44  zmoelnig

	* defined pragmas (on w32) to shut up compiler warnings (e.g.
	  because of unknown pragmas)

2005-10-07 16:43  zmoelnig

	* on w32 GL_ARB_fragment_program mightbe defined even if there is
	  no ARB-program support...(we really should switch to glew)

2005-10-07 16:42  zmoelnig

	* include <iostream> instead of <iostream.h> even on w32 (to use
	  the "new" stdlib)

2005-10-06 09:25  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD:
	  don't copy the "datasize" with copy2imageStruct - as it should
	  only be used internally for pdata;
	  (there is a captialized warning about breaking things in the
	  SIMD-branch log about this; however, i don't believe that it is
	  that dangerous)

2005-10-05 16:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-10-05 16:24  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD-branch

2005-10-05 16:14  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD

2005-10-05 16:02  zmoelnig

	* merged in changes from SIMD-branch

2005-10-05 15:42  zmoelnig

	* updated

2005-10-05 15:35  zmoelnig

	* changes from configure.ac

2005-10-05 15:22  zmoelnig

	* remove depend-files when "clean"

2005-10-05 15:14  zmoelnig

	* propery escaped test-string

2005-10-05 14:45  zmoelnig

	* use the CXX provided by configure

2005-10-05 14:38  zmoelnig

	* use AC_CHECK_FUNC rather than AC_CHECK_LIB to check for
	  glBindProgram{NV,ARB} since on osX we don't have a library libGL
	  but rather use the OpenGL-framework
	  
	  NOTE: the test for glBindProgramNV fails to detect the
	  nvidia-extensions on osX
	  why ? because you have to explicitely request them by defining
	  GL_NV_vertex_program before including the glext.h file on osX
	  on linux (mesaGL,...) it is different: the extensions are only
	  included, if GL_NV_vertex_program is NOT already defined

2005-10-05 14:14  zmoelnig

	* a compile on osX revealed that somewhere MIN and MAX are defined
	  as preprocessor directives; this stopped compiling the inline
	  functions with the same name; FIXED

2005-10-03 20:20  cclepper

	* initial commit. object for reading shared pixel memory between
	  processes.

2005-10-03 20:18  cclepper

	* initial commit. object for creating shared pixel memory between
	  processes.

2005-10-03 12:17  zmoelnig

	* added support for devicenames given as strings (like
	  "/dev/video")

2005-10-03 10:38  zmoelnig

	* removed the caching mechanism;
	  if you want to load a set of images and access from RAM, use
	  [pix_buffer] instead

2005-10-02 16:41  zmoelnig

	* made checking for changes in Base/config`uname -s`.h.in a bit
	  better

2005-10-02 13:52  zmoelnig

	* moved inclusion of openGL-headers to Base/GemGL.h

2005-10-02 13:48  zmoelnig

	* removed boolean-hack for buggy nvidia-headers (should get fixed
	  upstream)

2005-10-01 19:31  zmoelnig

	* checking for nvidia-extensions (can be disabled with
	  "--disable-NV")

2005-10-01 19:30  zmoelnig

	* checking for nvidia-extensions (can be disabled with
	  "--disable-NV")
	  added the system-specific config-file to the dependencies to do a
	  ./configure

2005-10-01 19:15  zmoelnig

	* test for definition of GL_{ARB,NV}_{vertex,fragment}_program
	  before using extensions.

2005-10-01 19:14  zmoelnig

	* moved the openGL-magic into Base/GemGL.h

2005-10-01 19:13  zmoelnig

	* moved the inclusion of openGL-headers and the openGL-magic into a
	  separate file GemGL.h (this should be included instead of the
	  system-specific openGL-header files)

2005-09-30 19:25  zmoelnig

	* now we can give the filename as argument and it gets loaded on
	  startRendering()
	  reordered everything a bit (and made fragment_program a child of
	  vertex_program: there's loads of similar code)

2005-09-28 04:29  cclepper

	* made sure glTexSubImage2D is called instead of the power of two
	  texturing

2005-09-27 17:56  zmoelnig

	* a fragment-shader demo that adds some b/w-noise...

2005-09-27 17:55  zmoelnig

	* a fragment shader that produces noise...

2005-09-27 17:04  zmoelnig

	* added vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 17:04  zmoelnig

	* added toon-shader for the vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 17:02  zmoelnig

	* added texture for the vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 16:34  zmoelnig

	* removed the "64 64" arguments to [pix_video] as this makes the
	  patches under windows unusable (pix_videoDS thinks the first
	  argument is the deviceID, not the dimension)

2005-09-27 15:44  zmoelnig

	* leftovers from pre pix_filmNEW aera.
	  deleted because i don't (want to) maintain this code any more

2005-09-27 15:42  zmoelnig

	* disable if FILM_NEW is defined in Base/config.h (then pix_filmNEW
	  and friends are used)

2005-09-27 05:17  tigital

	* added check for GL_VERSION_1_1, which is the lowest GL_VERSION
	  osx defines

2005-09-27 05:12  tigital

	* added define for GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT, duh

2005-09-26 17:47  zmoelnig

	* [pix_filmFFMPEG] is covered by [pix_filmNEW]+filmFFMPEG

2005-09-26 17:43  zmoelnig

	* made it _compile_ against the current CVS-version of ffmpeg (not
	  really tested whether it works though)
	  you have to actually change an ifdef at the beginning of
	  filmFFMPEG.cpp in order to make it compatible with the CVS-ffmpeg
	  (haven't found out yet, how to do this in a more generic way
	  (apart from hacking configure again)
	  btw, configure would need a lot of tweaking to recognize a
	  current ffmpeg (and link against all the needed libraries)
	  ffmpeg sucks

2005-09-22 17:41  zmoelnig

	* added fix to be able to display floats as numbers again (instead
	  of "float")

2005-09-22 08:32  zmoelnig

	* added moocows changes (+ linebreaking)
	  fixed the bug that prevented TextBase.cpp to build if you were
	  not using FTGL (gltt or no-font)

2005-09-21 18:41  tigital

	* cleanup apple headers

2005-09-21 18:37  tigital

	* reordering to shut up gcc4 warnings

2005-09-21 17:45  tigital

	* #ifdef'ed GLTTPixmapFont *m_afont like in text2d.cpp

2005-09-21 14:56  zmoelnig

	* committed tim's fix to prevent escaping of pd-special characters
	  (like ",")

2005-09-15 10:25  zmoelnig

	* removed the pre-defined maximum of control/grid-points: now we
	  can have curve3d's of any preecision

2005-09-11 16:09  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings: the changes are mostly removal of
	  unused variables, re-ordering of initialization of
	  member-variables, (un)signedness and proper bracketing when doing
	  comparisions

2005-09-11 16:04  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings: the changes are mostly removal of
	  unused variables, re-ordering of initialization of
	  member-variables and (un)signedness

2005-09-11 10:29  zmoelnig

	* enable fullscreen on X only if libXxf86vm is present

2005-09-11 10:25  zmoelnig

	* removed a bit of verbosity

2005-09-07 15:42  tigital

	* finally fixed sequence grabber dialog, so now OSX users can
	  select input devices!

2005-09-04 19:35  zmoelnig

	* added multiline-support (for FTGL) based on georg holzmann's code
	  however, multilines have to be broken into lines outside of the
	  [text]-objects;
	  linebreaks are denoted with "\n" (10)

2005-09-04 18:27  zmoelnig

	* initial video4linux-2 support;
	  right now, it seems to be rather slow!
	  a lot of functionality is not implemented yet (like setting the
	  channel)
	  
	  not yet for use!

2005-09-04 18:21  zmoelnig

	* GEM_OBJECTS are now a general {GEM_TARGETS}/*.o rather than each
	  object listed separately (some systems don't support such a long
	  list of arguments)

2005-09-02 21:58  cclepper

	* added loop to match codecType and codec value. makes pjpeg
	  default work on any machine.

2005-08-31 21:25  cclepper

	* added check for m_haveMovie in setRate to prevent crashing

2005-08-30 16:27  zmoelnig

	* a bit more verbosity on startup, so people will no what to send
	  to "driver"

2005-08-29 02:26  tigital

	* added outlet to output texture ID, which is useful for
	  multitexturing and ARB_programs...

2005-08-27 20:35  zmoelnig

	* maybe a hack to fix the tiny memory leak that i suspect to be in
	  the cache
	  LATER: really fix the cache (or remove it entirely)

2005-08-27 13:12  zmoelnig

	* free image-data when loading (after the image has been copied
	  into the buffer)

2005-08-26 16:40  zmoelnig

	* "binaries" for the latest changes to acinclude.m4 and
	  configure.ac

2005-08-26 16:39  zmoelnig

	* also make a check for package "lqt" (which is libquicktime),
	  since there might be an "lqt"-config installed.

2005-08-26 16:37  zmoelnig

	* (hopefully) even better library checking: if pkg-config cannot
	  find <libname>, we try <libname>-config to get the cflags and
	  libs.

2005-08-26 13:54  zmoelnig

	* test for libquicktime instead of quicktime (there exits a
	  pkg-config for libquicktime on debian)
	  do not automatically add "-lavcodec" when successfully testing
	  for avformat: either the pkg-config test succeeds or the user
	  should really provide PKG_FFMPEG_LIBS to get it right

2005-08-26 13:51  zmoelnig

	* a bit better: if PKG_<libname>_LIBS is defined from outside but
	  pkg-config fails, we do not test with AC_CHECK_PKG but trust the
	  user

2005-08-26 13:50  zmoelnig

	* include <quicktime.h> rather than <quicktime/quicktime.h>
	  the path may change and should be reported by autoconf

2005-08-26 12:31  zmoelnig

	* no freeframe support if sizeof(void*)!=sizeof(unsigned int)

2005-08-26 12:25  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the size of (void*) and (unsigned int) (on
	  x86_64 they are not the same (8 vs 4) and so casts won't work
	  (needed for pix_freeframe)

2005-08-26 12:22  zmoelnig

	* some information on how to workaround to get PIC-versions of
	  certain libraries (ffmpeg, ftgl)

2005-08-26 11:23  zmoelnig

	* forgot to remove update_pix_buffer()
	  remove m_buffer (since this is only used locally)

2005-08-25 22:37  cclepper

	* added regular and IIDC controls for video adjustment. tinkering
	  with vdig settings for capture rects.

2005-08-25 22:36  cclepper

	* more cleaning. fixed possible memory leak

2005-08-25 22:34  cclepper

	* fixed memory leak

2005-08-25 16:55  zmoelnig

	* further performance improvements (without crashes)

2005-08-25 15:59  zmoelnig

	* another attempt to get the fps from ffmpeg (the different
	  versions of this library with the same version-number are driving
	  me...)

2005-08-25 09:18  zmoelnig

	* there seem to be different versions of ffmpeg-4.0.9 around: one
	  (from CVS!) which takes an extra flags-argument for
	  av_seek_frame() and one that does not.
	  so i did an extra ifdef, whether the AV_SEEK_FLAGS are defined

2005-08-24 13:20  zmoelnig

	* implemented (similar to) georg's implementation (but made it less
	  crash prone)
	  should be faster, but if the content of the pix_buffer changes,
	  this is not automatically reflected on pix_buffer_read's outlet
	  (you must retrigger the index)

2005-08-24 12:34  zmoelnig

	* added "open"-message to read images (no movies yet)

2005-08-24 11:47  zmoelnig

	* verbosity now also states something about where it comes from
	  ("DV4L: closed" instead of "closed")

2005-08-24 11:45  zmoelnig

	* removed ifdef's; they should be handled by inheritance

2005-08-24 11:34  zmoelnig

	* query the FPS and report it to the info-outlet
	  (now we have: "list <numframes> <xsize> <ysize> <fps>";
	  should we split it into separate messages with prepends like "fps
	  <fps>" ??)

2005-08-24 11:29  zmoelnig

	* added a getFPS()-message to query the frames-per-second (as
	  reported by the decoding unit)

2005-08-23 15:01  zmoelnig

	* compiler shutups

2005-08-23 12:28  zmoelnig

	* started to crash again and then stopped (??); anyhow did some
	  more initialization

2005-08-22 17:06  zmoelnig

	* added some comments on why which decoding-library is placed where
	  moved FFMPEG backwards (as it fails more often than not and is
	  not really stable)

2005-08-22 16:43  zmoelnig

	* even more bug-fixes

2005-08-22 14:05  zmoelnig

	* bug-fix: now it is possible to decode some movies (i don't think
	  the code worked at all before)
	  more bug-fix: doesn't crash so easily anymore
	  even more bug-fix: allow seeking of frames when possible (but
	  this is rather seldom)

2005-08-22 14:03  zmoelnig

	* use initialization outside of constructor

2005-08-19 17:26  zmoelnig

	* fixed small type

2005-08-19 15:52  zmoelnig

	* added [{fragment,vertex}_program] from the vertex_array-branch.
	  (if DONT_USE_ARB is set, neither fragment- nor vertex-programs
	  should be build)
	  a bit of re-ordering of the include-files taken from the
	  vertex_array-branch: just in case we ever need to include GL/gl.h
	  in GemState.h, this would break all the weird glext-stuff,
	  because GL/gl.h would be included _before_ we do our magic; now
	  it should work

2005-08-19 15:49  zmoelnig

	* added [{fragmen,vertex}_program] from the vertex_array-branch.

2005-08-17 14:51  cclepper

	* changed some of the file loading code. should be faster to load a
	  movie now.

2005-08-17 14:49  cclepper

	* removed some debug lines

2005-08-17 08:12  zmoelnig

	* call the Makefile in src/ rather than src/Gnu

2005-08-16 04:40  tigital

	* [OSX] added menubar message to [gemwin]:
	  1 = show
	  0 = hide everything (full "kiosk" mode)
	  -1 = hide menubar, but autoShow with mouse at screen top
	  - this is only effective when gemwindow has "focus"

2005-08-01 19:13  cclepper

	* device selection works. started VDIG functions

2005-08-01 19:12  cclepper

	* new frame count outlet

2005-07-21 22:35  cclepper

	* added the basics for message based compression settings. Fixed
	  quite a few things

2005-07-21 17:59  zmoelnig

	* fixed the "clean" target

2005-07-19 22:55  cclepper

	* added ifdef for _APPLE__

2005-07-19 22:36  cclepper

	* initial commit

2005-07-16 17:36  zmoelnig

	* do checking for ARB even if specified explicitely (this also
	  turns on the check if you don't specify whether you want ARB or
	  not)

2005-07-15 13:29  zmoelnig

	* (changed 2 files, committed 4...)
	  a mechanism for finding files from optional libraries (those that
	  can be turned off with "--without-BLA")
	  "--with-BLA-includes=/bi/ba/bo" will add "-I/bi/ba/bo" to the
	  CXXFLAGS
	  "--with-BLA-libs=/foo/bar" will add "-L/foo/bar" to the LIBS
	  if the support for this library is turned OFF (--without-BLA),
	  then these flags will do nothing.
	  the arguments need be paths (a check is performed whether the
	  given directory exists)
	  however, they can also be relative paths!

2005-07-15 10:11  zmoelnig

	* checking for X-infrastructure on OS-X only if explicitely desired
	  by the user (with "--with-x"); by default it is turned off
	  added alias "--with-imagemagick" for "--with-ImageMagick"
	  fixed BUG, that prevented configure from checking for optional
	  libraries: if the checking for 1 library was turned off, all
	  consectuive libraries were automatically turned off too (i guess
	  it was the same with truning ON, but haven't tested)

2005-07-14 20:45  zmoelnig

	* more quoting in configure.ac
	  checked in configure, so people don't have to go through the
	  hazzle of autoconf

2005-07-14 20:38  zmoelnig

	* made the strip-test less verbose

2005-07-07 13:03  zmoelnig

	* use std::max() instead of max() as suggested by T.Schulze to make
	  it compile on windows with gcc; hope this doesn't break
	  M$VC-compilation
	  btw: pix_filmNT should NOT be used; use pix_filmNEW instead

2005-07-07 11:37  zmoelnig

	* added "--with-pd" flag for the bundle-loader; if neither this
	  flag is given nor PD_BINARY is set, $(which pd) is used (so the
	  path pd should be in $PATH)

2005-07-07 11:30  zmoelnig

	* fixed GEM_CHECK_LDFLAGS: better detection whether sucess or not
	  fixed GEM_CHECK_FRAMEWORK: "-framwork" is a linker flag instead
	  of a compiler flag. adapted changes to GEM_CHECK_LDFLAGS
	  
	  also included acinclude.m4, since this is really just a copy of
	  aclocal.m4 (with my automake) and adding this files removes a
	  dependency on automake

2005-07-07 11:25  zmoelnig

	* delete depen-files

2005-07-07 11:24  zmoelnig

	* use "-C"-flag to make instead of "cd" when (dist)cleaning
	  subdirectories

2005-07-07 11:22  zmoelnig

	* moved stuff from GemLibs/darwinStuff/ into GemMath.h
	  reflect this in the files that included the old files

2005-07-07 07:34  zmoelnig

	* moved variable declarations to the beginning of the
	  open()-function, so they are not crossed by goto-jumps

2005-07-07 07:28  zmoelnig

	* removed call to class_set_extern_dir() in __APPLE__

2005-07-04 18:05  zmoelnig

	* copied from Gnu/README.build and added more information

2005-07-04 12:11  zmoelnig

	* set glNormal3f() before rendering, so [text3d] becomes robust
	  against changing the normal from outside (e.g. like
	  [textextruded])
	  is this is a bug in ftgl ?

2005-07-04 12:10  zmoelnig

	* changed __apple__ to __APPLE__

2005-07-04 11:54  zmoelnig

	* more beautiful (?) output on failure...

2005-07-04 11:17  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX rather than __linux__

2005-07-04 11:16  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX rather than __linux__
	  commented out some verbosity

2005-07-04 11:05  zmoelnig

	* turn of debug mode

2005-07-04 09:22  zmoelnig

	* you can now specify a preferred library for decoding a file.
	  if one is specified, it is tried as the first lib. if it fails,
	  all libs are tried in the default order (read: the specified lib
	  is tried twice: once as the preferred lib, and once as part of
	  all libs)

2005-07-04 09:20  zmoelnig

	* print "<codec> failed" when not being able to open instead of
	  "<codec> unsupported"

2005-07-04 09:18  zmoelnig

	* fixed codec initialization

2005-07-04 08:43  zmoelnig

	* renamed GEM_WITH_TARGET to GEM_TARGET (and use AC_ARG_ENABLE
	  instead of AC_ARG_WITH)

2005-07-04 08:42  zmoelnig

	* Gem.${EXT} depends on subdirs

2005-07-04 08:40  zmoelnig

	* added flag for videofilm-new
	  removed "Base" from the selectable modules

2005-07-04 08:36  zmoelnig

	* added a function for swapping Red and Blue that works in-place

2005-07-04 08:35  zmoelnig

	* added comments
	  added NEW_VIDEOFILM

2005-07-03 19:03  zmoelnig

	* added check for "dos2unix"

2005-07-03 18:53  zmoelnig

	* use "-MM" for "make depend" with gnu-preprocessors

2005-07-03 18:42  zmoelnig

	* updated build-system after having a look at the Gnu-make
	  documentation
	  what's better:
	  SOURCES are generated on the fly
	  .cpp-files containing whitespaces are ignored (rather than
	  crashing the build.process)
	  dependencies are calculated on a per-file basis (rather than via
	  Make.depend)
	  better subdirectory handling (not for "clean"ing though)
	  better check for "strip" (partly taken from wine)

2005-06-29 15:44  zmoelnig

	* use size_t for datasize

2005-06-29 14:45  zmoelnig

	* use "size_t" for dataSize instead of "int" or "long" or "unsigned
	  char" ...

2005-06-27 16:11  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-06-26 18:03  zmoelnig

	* prettier results
	  better handling of "strip"

2005-06-26 17:38  zmoelnig

	* use configure to set the extension
	  -"- to set reference-path
	  -"- to set STRIP (on real check though)

2005-06-26 15:33  zmoelnig

	* added checks for LDFLAGS

2005-06-26 15:11  zmoelnig

	* HAVE_LIBAV{format,codec} is now convered by HAVE_FFMPEG
	  additionally we now have a HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX

2005-06-26 15:07  zmoelnig

	* framework-checks and cxxflags-checks

2005-06-26 12:46  zmoelnig

	* "configure"-target

2005-06-26 12:39  zmoelnig

	* works better (still not yet where we want to be)

2005-06-25 16:49  zmoelnig

	* first try of a new build-system based on g� code, autoconf>2.57
	  and that gets rid of the Gnu-directory

2005-06-20 14:47  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2005-06-20 14:47  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation (thanks to georg holzmann)

2005-06-20 14:41  zmoelnig

	* fixed documentation

2005-06-20 14:41  zmoelnig

	* added newline to end of file

2005-06-19 18:45  zmoelnig

	* replaced WIN32 (or NT) (or _WINDOWS) (or...) by __WIN32__

2005-06-19 18:41  zmoelnig

	* replaced WIN32 with __WIN32__

2005-06-19 18:38  zmoelnig

	* unix2dos (m$vc does _not_ like unix-linebreaks in the dsp-file)
	  added newer files
	  use __WIN32__ instead of other windows-defines

2005-06-19 18:36  zmoelnig

	* added DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT (i think this is the default on most
	  windows-compile-machines, and currently it fails to work on my
	  setting, when i have time to fix it, i will re-enable glext on
	  w32)

2005-06-19 18:34  zmoelnig

	* renamed defines "NT", "WIN32" and "_WINDOWS" by "__WIN32__"

2005-06-19 18:32  zmoelnig

	* suddenly m$vc didn't like variables "near" and "far", so i
	  renamed them to "m_near" and "m_far"

2005-06-19 17:11  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed (re)definition of WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN

2005-06-19 17:10  zmoelnig

	* fixed recursion-bug with distance()

2005-06-19 16:58  zmoelnig

	* added re-definition of GLU_SILHOUETTE _after_ including the
	  openGL-headers

2005-06-14 06:57  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug discovered (and fixed) by matju, where image-files
	  that opened but turned out to be a non-sgi-image, where not
	  closed again.

2005-06-09 16:09  ggeiger

	* Replaced "Programme" with PROGRAMFILES environment variable for
	  finding m_pd.h

2005-06-09 15:35  ggeiger

	* use ProgramFiles variable to detect path to pd

2005-06-03 09:29  zmoelnig

	* on linux, we are using pix_videoNEW instead of pix_videoLinux for
	  ages, it's time to remove it.
	  hopefully we can do this for other platforms sometime as well

2005-06-03 09:20  zmoelnig

	* GemDAG has been obsoleted for years, it's time to remove it.
	  (probably something similar will reappear once we have threaded
	  rendering to multiple windows)

2005-06-03 09:10  zmoelnig

	* removed: people should (well, now they "must") run autoconf in
	  order to generate their own configure-script

2005-06-03 09:09  zmoelnig

	* added a note that tells people to run "autoconf" before
	  "./configure"

2005-06-03 08:57  zmoelnig

	* colors can now be RGB or (new:) RGBA

2005-06-03 06:55  zmoelnig

	* commented out XCloseDisplay() which keeps Gem from freezing but
	  is only a direty workaround (memory-leak + X-server hates too
	  many open displays)
	  added a big warning to not forget it....

2005-06-03 06:54  zmoelnig

	* HELPSYMBOL_BASE must be defined _before_ including CPPExtern.h to
	  have any effect

2005-06-02 11:25  zmoelnig

	* added YUV-support
	  normalized output to 0..1 (instead of 0..255)
	  always output RGBA-values (even for grayscale and YUV; alpha
	  defaults to 1.0)

2005-06-01 16:42  tigital

	* [OSX] OpenGL headers are now centrally located in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 16:40  tigital

	* corrected description

2005-06-01 16:35  tigital

	* [OSX] OpenGL headers are in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 16:34  tigital

	* [OSX] correct call to dialogCallback, not dialogMess (shuts up
	  gcc4.0 warning); small header change

2005-06-01 16:28  tigital

	* [NEW] added scale variable for scale of halftone
	  [OSX] compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support
	  of sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 15:57  tigital

	* [OSX] converted the last of the MACOSX to __APPLE__ ifdef's?

2005-06-01 15:48  tigital

	* coalesced #ifdef between linux & apple (since they are the same
	  typedefs)

2005-06-01 15:46  tigital

	* [OSX] corrected #ifdef and added LPVOID define

2005-06-01 15:43  tigital

	* [OSX] compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support
	  of sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 15:40  tigital

	* header includes now centralized in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 15:38  tigital

	* [OSX] converted the last of the MACOSX to __APPLE__ ifdef's?

2005-06-01 15:36  tigital

	* more readable formatting

2005-06-01 15:32  tigital

	* [OSX] compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support
	  of sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 15:27  tigital

	* corrected spelling of SetVertex()

2005-06-01 15:20  tigital

	* now includes all OpenGL/ headers for OSX

2005-06-01 15:16  tigital

	* switched from vec_unpack2sh() (which apparently never existed,
	  yet worked prior to 10.4.x!) to vec_mergeh(); new #ifdef
	  __TIMING__ for timing frame process of altivec vs. scalar color
	  conversions

2005-06-01 15:08  tigital

	* added "#ifdef unix" so osx doesn't try compiling it (at least
	  until the future?)

2005-06-01 15:06  tigital

	* gcc4.0 fixes and miscellaneous cleanups: AGL's swapinterval now
	  set in BuildGLContext()

2005-06-01 14:59  tigital

	* needed for proper Darwin configure-ing

2005-06-01 14:56  tigital

	* added Darwin configure stuff

2005-06-01 14:54  tigital

	* replaced ".pd_linux" with $(TARGET) so that we can use this on
	  more than one platform

2005-05-30 19:54  zmoelnig

	* use "ffmpeg-config --plugin-libs" instead of "ffmpeg-config
	  --libs"
	  this allows us to link on x86_64 without problems

2005-05-25 18:44  zmoelnig

	* looked at the ugly #define-hacks and got some things right
	  note: these classes should vanish altogether on all platforms and
	  be replaced by the NEW-thingie.

2005-05-23 15:03  zmoelnig

	* made libjpeg and libtiff OPTIONAL libraries (which are used by
	  default if available)
	  so platforms that dont have these libs (like OSX) don't fail to
	  configure any more

2005-05-23 15:01  zmoelnig

	* added HAVE_LIBJPEG and HAVE_LIBTIFF in order to compile with
	  image reading/writing support

2005-05-23 14:58  zmoelnig

	* made JPEG and TIFF reading/writing a compile-option
	  this removes the _hard_ dependency on libjpeg and libtiff, which
	  should make the configure easier on platforms that don't need
	  libjpeg/libtiff

2005-05-23 12:11  zmoelnig

	* enforcing of the presence of libtiff, libjpeg and libpng is only
	  need on linux (btw, it shouldn't be enforced here too!)

2005-05-23 11:59  zmoelnig

	* better detection for FFMPEG (now we also have autodetection; i
	  hope ffmpeg has stabilized the API enough, so this won't break
	  for some months)

2005-05-23 11:56  zmoelnig

	* added preprocessor-flags CPPFLAGS to the compiler-flags

2005-05-23 09:29  zmoelnig

	* enforce X only on Linux (Darwin can do without)

2005-05-23 09:02  zmoelnig

	* on "distclean" remove ALL .o (and .obj) files, even those that
	  are not in Make.source

2005-05-21 02:34  tigital

	* corrected spelling

2005-05-19 11:41  zmoelnig

	* did better quoting, this should fix the issues with autoconf>2.53

2005-05-17 14:00  zmoelnig

	* changed uname-flags "--machine" and "--kernel-name" to "-m" and
	  "-s" (which should work on osX too

2005-05-17 00:24  tigital

	* updates for config system that identify darwin 10.4

2005-05-13 19:48  zmoelnig

	* [pix_crop] now straights images that are upside down (this is: if
	  you have the same pix-material as both "normal" and "upsidedown",
	  the same parameters to [pix_crop] will now produce the same
	  results
	  this change has the same performance as the old one, it just
	  makes life easier

2005-05-10 16:51  zmoelnig

	* added [spot_light] by Pierre-Oliver Charlebois;
	  did some changes to make it use the world_light parent-class
	  instead of reinventing the wheel. hope this doesn't break
	  anything with the original version

2005-05-04 18:31  zmoelnig

	* fixed the "external" pix_buffer_class

2005-05-04 13:22  zmoelnig

	* added a flag to declare the pdclass-definition non-static (so we
	  can findbyclass() from other objects)

2005-05-04 13:21  zmoelnig

	* finally made [pix_buffer_read] and [pix_buffer_write] to be in
	  their own source-files
	  added automatic playback and cyclic reading of [pix_buffer_read]
	  (based on an idea of Florian Grond & Lasse Scherffig)

2005-05-03 17:32  zmoelnig

	* entry for DONT_USE_ARB

2005-05-03 17:31  zmoelnig

	* added runtime-checking for glBindProgramARB
	  the results are displayed in Base/configLinux.h rather than via
	  command-line args to the compiler

2005-05-03 15:47  zmoelnig

	* added some verbose output at the end of configuration, so the
	  user will know what is going on

2005-05-03 11:35  zmoelnig

	* on windows (and maybe osX too?) the host-side interface looks a
	  bit different than on linux
	  a couple of #define's should fix that.
	  
	  fixed an error on windows+osX that came from stupid copy'n'paste
	  from the pd-sources for dynamic loading
	  
	  the FreeFrame-specs said something about a "maximum" of 8
	  parameters, which is exceeded by some plugins as i just noticed;
	  removed the clamping of numparams to 8 (don't know why it was
	  there in the first place)
	  
	  i hope this includes the changes needed to make it compile on osX
	  haven't tested these changes on windows yet, but after my
	  experiences i made yesterday when i booted into windows, it
	  _should_ work

2005-04-27 09:26  zmoelnig

	* changed behaviour for rectangle textures to be conformant to the
	  behaviour with non-rectangle textures::
	  "1,1" always denotes the upper-right corner of the pixel-buffer,
	  so the user need not care what kind of texture they are using

2005-04-27 09:24  zmoelnig

	* set "state->texture" to "2", when using rectangle textures
	  don't overwrite "m_repeat" with "GL_CLAMP" when doing
	  rectangle-textures, as they will ignore that flag anyhow

2005-04-27 09:21  zmoelnig

	* more advanced usage of the "texture": 2==rectangle (so we can
	  react on the specifics of rectangle-textures in downstream
	  objects)

2005-04-26 03:34  tigital

	* corrected yv12 to rgb on osx, yv12 to rgba/bgra, and error
	  reporting for copy2ImageStruct

2005-04-26 01:58  tigital

	* changed boolean to bool, which is osx-compilable and more in line
	  with the rest of gem's codebase

2005-04-25 17:01  zmoelnig

	* help-patch for [pix_movement2]

2005-04-25 17:00  zmoelnig

	* another object that tries to get the movement within an
	  image-stream

2005-04-24 21:59  cclepper

	* added check for state->texture and that actual coordinates exist
	  in the render method

2005-04-21 14:58  zmoelnig

	* initial support for loading plugins un windows and osX (still not
	  tested)

2005-04-21 12:05  zmoelnig

	* fixed...

2005-04-21 11:46  zmoelnig

	* added an enable-flag for --freg-struct-return (for
	  FreeFrame-plugins)
	  since i am not sure what this will break it is disabled by
	  default;
	  if you want to use the FreeFrame-plugins, the option is either to
	  compile Gem with this flag or to recompile the plugins without...

2005-04-21 09:42  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug that crashed pd/Gem when an exception was thrown (wrong
	  type...)
	  fixed bug with a parameter-offset of 1

2005-04-20 17:31  zmoelnig

	* initial support for FreeFrame-plugins
	  currently i have only tested this on linux

2005-04-18 17:06  zmoelnig

	* usage of the "--disable-ARB" to disable ARB-vertex-shaders

2005-04-18 17:02  zmoelnig

	* adding a "--disable-ARB" flag for disabling the build of
	  ARB-vertex-programs

2005-04-18 15:59  zmoelnig

	* added feed-back when checking for avifile
	  (before, there was nothing indicating that libavifile will be
	  used if (and only if) it was found)

2005-04-18 15:52  zmoelnig

	* added support for ImageMagick++ (used here for loading and saving
	  images)

2005-04-18 15:51  zmoelnig

	* added support for ImageMagick (currently used for loading/writing
	  images)

2005-04-18 14:08  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug that crashed Gem when using this object with
	  [pix_imageInPlace]: the texcoord-array was accessed without
	  checking the size of it first!!

2005-04-18 13:17  zmoelnig

	* regrouped things even more (put type-checks before
	  library-checks)

2005-04-18 12:52  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up autoconf a bit
	  + prelaminary support for icc
	  + grouped header/library search together
	  + FIRST search whether headers are present, THEN look for
	  matching libraries
	  + hopefully fixed bug, where compile stopped when no
	  font-rendering-libs where installed

2005-04-13 17:33  zmoelnig

	* a function that claims to return an integer should return an
	  integer

2005-04-11 16:14  tigital

	* [stupid]correct name in header

2005-04-07 12:52  zmoelnig

	* an example for using display-lists

2005-04-07 11:06  zmoelnig

	* help for [scopeXYZ~]

2005-04-06 19:02  zmoelnig

	* made [scopeXYZ~] work (although there is still one single point
	  left that sometimes occurs at 0/0/0)

2005-04-05 10:52  zmoelnig

	* added wrapper for glEndList() and glNewList(): this is cool as it
	  allows to makeuser defined display-lists (performance boost)

2005-04-04 16:50  zmoelnig

	* a help-patch

2005-04-04 16:27  zmoelnig

	* adapted to the longer feature-vectors of [pix_multiblob];
	  a first help-patch

2005-04-04 16:24  zmoelnig

	* output more information (like minX/Y, weighted position,...)
	  weighted position produces more stable tracking

2005-04-01 07:45  zmoelnig

	* #ifdef'ed the altivec code properly, so it will compile on other
	  systems as well

2005-04-01 01:26  tigital

	* initial altivec speedups to: bgra to yuv; yv12 to yuv

2005-03-31 16:25  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a bit

2005-03-31 16:07  zmoelnig

	* missed a "break" in a case-loop.

2005-03-31 15:58  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)
	  
	  (and fix the parsing of the drawstyle a big)

2005-03-31 15:55  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 15:47  zmoelnig

	* a blobtracker based on [pix_multiblob] and some objects from
	  "iemmatrix"

2005-03-31 15:00  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 14:58  zmoelnig

	* added a new drawType "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" (since using "-1" was a bad
	  idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 14:40  zmoelnig

	* changed LIBS="-Wl,-shared -Wl,-export-dynamic $LIBS" to
	  LIBS="-shared -Wl,-export-dynamic $LIBS"
	  this should fix the problem with FC3

2005-03-31 06:42  zmoelnig

	* there are even better conversions (at least you can control all
	  YUV<->RGB conversion on a central point)

2005-03-30 20:02  zmoelnig

	* a detector for multiple blobs (no tracking! as this should be
	  done externally);
	  the output-data is in zexy/iemmatrix's "matrix" format; i am not
	  sure whether this is really good (as it makes libraries
	  interdependent and of course i favour my own libs) but it is much
	  more elegant than anything else i could think of

2005-03-30 19:48  zmoelnig

	* new Geos: [scopeXYZ~] and [torus]

2005-03-30 19:00  zmoelnig

	* added "default"-drawtype

2005-03-22 20:41  zmoelnig

	* changed RGB<->YUV conversion to be more standards-compliant;
	  clamped the results

2005-03-22 02:48  tigital

	* more OpenGL wrappers I've had sitting on my drive

2005-03-09 00:24  tigital

	* IOhannes: the gl headers and such are in GemMan.h: why would you
	  want to put them in GemMan.cpp? I'm a big fan of including
	  headers in, um, the header :-) Btw, the "GL/ vs. OpenGL/" thing
	  is due to apple's use of framework's...

2005-03-07 15:33  zmoelnig

	* use DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT rather than the INCLUDE_GLEXT (which is
	  nowhere defined)

2005-03-07 15:31  zmoelnig

	* properly include GL/glext.h (btw, wtfh are apple's openGL-headers
	  in openGL/ instead of GL/ ... nevermind)

2005-03-07 09:19  zmoelnig

	* include <new> to enable the use of real C++ constructors

2005-03-06 11:21  zmoelnig

	* removed [change] (is in pd for some times)

2005-02-28 01:15  tigital

	* - added support for YV12(short*) for pdp2gem
	  - added support for RGB/BGR to setCsizeByFormat
	  - began altivec support (non-functional atm)

2005-02-28 00:05  tigital

	* - added support for YV12(short*) for pdp2gem
	  - added support for RGB/BGR to setCsizeByFormat
	  - began altivec support (non-functional atm)

2005-02-07 18:18  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up, and removed crashes

2005-02-07 15:56  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug that crashed pd when NULL was returned by glGetString()

2005-02-07 15:31  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit

2005-02-07 15:05  zmoelnig

	* windoze does not like array-sizes that are determined at runtime

2005-02-07 13:42  zmoelnig

	* catching errors that might get thrown by glx

2005-02-07 13:21  zmoelnig

	* use Base/GemVector instead of own CVector3

2005-02-07 13:20  zmoelnig

	* a class for 3D-vectors (formerly found in Manips/camera)

2005-02-07 12:46  zmoelnig

	* oh, it's here again...

2005-02-07 12:45  zmoelnig

	* [pix_dv] is covered by [pix_video]

2005-02-07 12:43  zmoelnig

	* updated a bit

2005-02-07 12:04  zmoelnig

	* hopefully really fixed the including of GL/glext.h:
	  use DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT instead of INCLUDE_GLEXT
	  additionally use GL_GLEXT_LEGACY, as this auto-includes glext.h
	  on some sytems (mesa)

2005-02-07 12:02  zmoelnig

	* use FILM__NEW instead of __FILM__NEW
	  use DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT instead of INCLUDE_GLEXT

2005-02-07 12:00  zmoelnig

	* fixed defines:
	  gl*TransposeMatrix() are available onle on openGL>=1.3 (not >=1.1
	  as it was)
	  gl*ARB() were used only, if GL_ARB_vertex_program was
	  un(!)defined...

2005-01-31 17:50  tigital

	* updated to my setup

2005-01-14 08:54  zmoelnig

	* added the missing " to the NEW_VIDEOFILM definition

2005-01-14 08:53  zmoelnig

	* ./configure does not call "makesource" but includes it; thus the
	  "$@" is not as expected an (empty) list of directories for which
	  we should generate Make.source but rather "dummy sh";
	  now we check, whether the running script ($0) is "*configure",
	  and if so, we assume that the "passed" list is 0.

2005-01-12 19:20  zmoelnig

	* oops again; forgot a "

2005-01-12 18:12  zmoelnig

	* oops; should run again
	  (note: this is just rev1.27 with __NEW__ replaced by
	  NEW_VIDEOFILM)

2005-01-11 11:45  zmoelnig

	* who the f**k used "__NEW__" to enable/disable different
	  film/movie-objects ???
	  preprocessor-defines starting with "__" are system only!!
	  i have renamed __NEW__ to NEW_VIDEOFILM __FILM __NEW to FILM_NEW
	  and __VIDEO__NEW to VIDEO_NEW

2005-01-11 10:22  zmoelnig

	* added Exceptions: whenever we don't want an object to be created
	  because of boundary-conditions (e.g. wrong arguments) we can now
	  throw a GemException("errorstring") which is caught by the
	  setup-routine and prevents the object from being created;
	  
	  fixed the m_objectname thing: now even the constructor of a
	  GemObject will now the name that was used to create it (as far as
	  we can tell)

2004-12-26 17:43  tigital

	* oops! shouldn't include "Base/GemFuncUtil.h" after #ifdef
	  __cplusplus extern "C" {...}

2004-12-24 09:54  timblech

	* fixed bug

2004-12-22 18:03  tigital

	* - header consolidation: #includes should go in headers (or in
	  this case, already are)!

2004-12-22 17:49  tigital

	* ppc only: sqrt speed up via assembly instruction (at least 2x)
	  - header consolidation: #includes should go in headers!
	  - correctly converts YUV to RGBA and back, if needed

2004-12-22 17:48  tigital

	* ppc only: sqrt speed up via assembly instruction (at least 2x)
	  - header consolidation: #includes should go in headers!
	  - now fills/uses Gem's gluLookAt()

2004-12-22 17:46  tigital

	* ppc only: sqrt speed up via assembly instruction (at least 2x)
	  - header consolidation: #includes should go in headers!

2004-12-22 17:00  tigital

	* rearrange/coalesce headers, added glu.h

2004-12-22 16:58  tigital

	* add functions for 5 arguments

2004-12-15 06:21  tigital

	* cleanup dialogMess

2004-12-15 06:17  tigital

	* fixed crash bug when changing dimen or colorspace while
	  rendering: some header cleanup, too

2004-12-14 00:02  tigital

	* update to my setup

2004-12-13 13:22  zmoelnig

	* fixed the patch; how comes it is broken at all ? a check ensured,
	  that even the example-patch from gem-0.70 has the same
	  weirdnesses - so the problem seems to be a change in the
	  pd-fileformat rather than the patch itself; this should work now
	  (although i am not sure, whether it really does what it is
	  supposed to do...)
	  wow, what a long changelog....

2004-12-07 15:05  timblech

	* simplified outlet

2004-12-07 13:24  timblech

	* initial checkin pix_mean_color

2004-12-03 12:15  zmoelnig

	* added newline at end of file

2004-11-28 00:00  tigital

	* some wrappers for gl "program" stuff: should be ok for any GL
	  with ARB_vertex_program and/or ARB_fragment_program defined

2004-11-27 23:51  tigital

	* wrappers for gl matrix stuff: should be ok for all opengl
	  versions since 1.1?

2004-11-27 23:47  tigital

	* pedantic changes to header & descriptions :-)

2004-11-27 23:46  tigital

	* added defines for multitexture, vertex/fragment programs, and
	  matrix stuff...plus pragma's to more easily find the numerical
	  seperations

2004-11-24 15:53  zmoelnig

	* Cyrille's [gemlist_info] that gets the current
	  transformation-matrix
	  (why have i not added this long before ???)

2004-11-24 15:46  zmoelnig

	* made the new size settable;
	  LATER think about using a *faster* algorithm...

2004-11-24 15:37  zmoelnig

	* added templates for the gem2pdp-bridge

2004-11-05 14:33  tigital

	* added comments about auto message

2004-11-05 14:32  tigital

	* added blend message

2004-10-20 14:10  tigital

	* // powerOfTwo() optimization from "Hacker's Delight": much
	  faster!

2004-10-12 18:34  zmoelnig

	* use the provided dv1394.h instead of an external one

2004-10-12 18:34  zmoelnig

	* added dv1394.h from "dvgrab"-sources

2004-10-12 11:51  zmoelnig

	* use the dv1394.h from the kernel and not the deprecated-one from
	  libdv-dev

2004-10-11 09:11  zmoelnig

	* [gemkeyname] under linux now behaves more like pd's [keyname]
	  (e.g. uniform keynames); thanks to gerard van dongen

2004-10-08 14:47  zmoelnig

	* we don't want this anymore: all objects are autoregistering

2004-10-08 14:46  zmoelnig

	* don't want this anymore: objects are auto-registering themselves!

2004-10-08 14:29  zmoelnig

	* don't want this anymore: objects are auto-registering themselves!

2004-10-08 14:08  zmoelnig

	* as cyrille requested: doing one more point... (hope this doesn't
	  break anything, but i guess cyrille is the only one who really
	  cares about such features)

2004-10-08 13:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed argument handling:
	  1 argument: gridX=gridY
	  2 arguments: gridX, gridY
	  3 arguments: gridX, gridY, height

2004-09-15 15:41  zmoelnig

	* new and updated help-patches (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 15:18  zmoelnig

	* initial addition (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 15:06  zmoelnig

	* initial addition (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 14:50  zmoelnig

	* merged the newWave_texture in;
	  incorporated cyrilles changes: added dither-noise against
	  denormalization phenomenons: wouldn't it be better clamp
	  denormals to 0 like with PD_BADLFOAT ??

2004-09-15 13:15  zmoelnig

	* cyrilles changes: made the number of faces settable via a
	  message#9

2004-08-27 06:47  zmoelnig

	* moved from src/Geos to src/Vertex;
	  include <GL/gl.h> instead of <OpenGL/gl.h> on non-apples

2004-08-26 12:21  zmoelnig

	* moved all the vertex_-objects from src/Geos to src/Vertex;
	  added vertex_mul, vertex_add
	  vertex_offset,... now work on all arrays

2004-08-17 12:53  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug when no directory-list is given at command-line

2004-08-17 12:01  zmoelnig

	* this has vanished entirely (i just don't know how to check files
	  into a branch)

2004-08-10 09:43  zmoelnig

	* an object to render into external displays (this is: the context
	  is *not* handled by Gem but by an external application)

2004-08-10 09:40  zmoelnig

	* oje: "tagged" instead of "branched" (anyhow gemwindow_qtExt is
	  already deprecated)

2004-08-09 17:36  zmoelnig

	* initial makefile for [gemwindow_qtExt]

2004-08-09 17:36  zmoelnig

	* initial output-module:
	  [gemwindow_qtExt] (what an ugly name!) to render to external
	  qt-contexts

2004-08-08 11:45  zmoelnig

	* set the viewpoint immediately (do *not* use GemMan::m_view)

2004-08-04 06:32  zmoelnig

	* now you can give a list of directories on the command-line to
	  override the default directories where we want the
	  Make.source,... to be built

2004-07-23 08:25  zmoelnig

	* added top-level makefile and configure-script (since src/Gnu is
	  hard to find)

2004-07-06 13:09  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo in comment

2004-07-02 16:17  zmoelnig

	* new things to do

2004-07-01 19:00  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-code;
	  includes for the various platforms/SIMD-optimization should be
	  handled in here

2004-06-30 14:32  zmoelnig

	* rebuild the texture when switching between rectangle and
	  normalized textures

2004-06-30 12:13  zmoelnig

	* used debug() instead of post() for the "client-storage"-message

2004-06-30 12:11  zmoelnig

	* using RGB24 instead of RGB32, because the alpha-channel is set to
	  0 by RGB32(!!)

2004-05-28 11:50  zmoelnig

	* updated for 0.90

2004-05-26 10:59  zmoelnig

	* now the "release" compiles

2004-05-26 10:35  zmoelnig

	* changed version from 0.888 to 0.90

2004-05-26 10:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed "installation" for on windows

2004-05-26 10:34  zmoelnig

	* changed from 0.888pre2 to 0.90

2004-05-19 15:57  zmoelnig

	* changed the shifts to SHIFT_* to make it cross-platform

2004-05-19 15:25  tigital

	* *** empty log message ***

2004-05-19 15:18  tigital

	* here's what I came up with: luma seems more sensitive, and makes
	  a better image, tho different than the rgba version

2004-05-16 19:22  zmoelnig

	* fixed some issues with compiling Gem on windows with nvidia's
	  openGL-headers (have to include glext.h)

2004-05-15 17:59  zmoelnig

	* noted that pix_lumaoffset might crash with high offset-factors

2004-05-14 17:20  zmoelnig

	* added a "yuv"-message to turn off direct YUV-texturing even if it
	  is available (because our G4 with a geforce4MX says that it can
	  do GL_ycbcr but actually the images look weird

2004-05-14 17:05  zmoelnig

	* added range-checking for the offset when doing smoothed & filled
	  processing;
	  this should fix the crashes at very high offsets on all
	  colorspaces

2004-05-14 15:42  zmoelnig

	* fixed YUV on big-endians

2004-05-13 17:25  zmoelnig

	* don't copy "pdata" with copyImage2Struct; pdata should always(!)
	  be a pointer to some data that is owned by the image itself!
	  this fixes the abiding crashes when deleting pix_-objects

2004-05-10 08:08  zmoelnig

	* added additional error-checks and a sanity-check on close();
	  should run now on QT-6.5 (as (un)stable as with QT-6.4)

2004-05-10 05:03  cclepper

	* First step at separating the color-space functions in order to
	  have them work properly. RGBA is still ok, and now YUV works on
	  'uniform' adjustments.

2004-05-10 03:54  cclepper

	* #ifdef to remove YUV code on OSX. maybe someone will write a
	  version that doesn't crash?

2004-05-09 07:03  cclepper

	* changed the shifts for YUV output. now 100% less green.

2004-05-08 04:19  cclepper

	* fixed the 'it's oh so green' YUV problem on OSX

2004-05-07 17:51  zmoelnig

	* made defines for shifts on mac/non-mac (although they don't do
	  much now)

2004-05-07 17:48  zmoelnig

	* added U8 as another type

2004-05-07 17:41  zmoelnig

	* using ch*-constants rather than hardcoded positions of
	  channel-data
	  (e.g: chRed instead of 0)

2004-05-07 17:39  zmoelnig

	* shut up macOS-gcc compiler warnings

2004-05-07 15:42  zmoelnig

	* type fixing to shut down the compiler

2004-05-07 13:52  zmoelnig

	* made Grey work

2004-05-07 12:02  zmoelnig

	* made YUV and Grey work

2004-05-07 08:42  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat
	  use reallocate() instead of clear() and allocate() and
	  complicated checks

2004-05-07 08:40  zmoelnig

	* fixed stupid typo

2004-05-07 08:40  zmoelnig

	* replaced hardcoded shift-amount by SHIFT_Y.
	  use setCsizeByFormat
	  use reallocate() instead of clear() and allocate()

2004-05-07 08:30  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat
	  use reallocate() instead of clear() and allocate()
	  removed unused variable

2004-05-07 08:29  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat
	  use reallocate() instead of clear() and allocate()

2004-05-07 08:28  zmoelnig

	* removed the commented out the processGray-function (and not only
	  it's body);
	  use setCsizeByFormat

2004-05-07 08:14  zmoelnig

	* don't initialize to small images (64x64) any more as this is only
	  for memory fragmentation

2004-05-07 08:12  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat rather than setting csize/format/type
	  directly

2004-05-07 08:11  zmoelnig

	* made YUV work on PCs (and used better namings (like "U" instead
	  of "Red")

2004-05-06 10:01  zmoelnig

	* setting the csize/format/type of the image more intelligently

2004-05-06 09:36  zmoelnig

	* another step towards a working version.
	  now yuv/rgba/grey almost(!) behave the same

2004-05-06 09:35  zmoelnig

	* the RGBA2LUMA conversion was wrong

2004-05-05 14:56  zmoelnig

	* made YUV work correctly

2004-05-05 14:56  zmoelnig

	* use run-time checks for YUV-texturing

2004-05-05 14:55  zmoelnig

	* added run-time checks for GL_APPLE_ycbcr_422 (YUV-texturing)

2004-05-05 14:54  zmoelnig

	* use normal memory-allocation (no alignment tricks as these
	  produces weird output)
	  LATER make sure that memory is aligned correctly

2004-05-04 20:20  zmoelnig

	* quick hack to make Grey/YUV work

2004-05-04 15:30  zmoelnig

	* initialized orgPixBlock to NULL (should fix crashes when no
	  upstream image is present)

2004-05-04 12:46  zmoelnig

	* seems to work now with RGBA/YUV/Grayscale

2004-05-04 08:15  zmoelnig

	* added bugs concerning win32-movie-loading

2004-05-03 16:27  zmoelnig

	* used SHIFT_Y1,... (from GemPixPete.h) as my images were green ;-)

2004-05-03 16:26  zmoelnig

	* defined SHIFT_Y1,... for YUV-shifting

2004-05-03 06:15  cclepper

	* fixed up the YUV code - rolled a new black function and tests for
	  proper pixel values

2004-05-03 06:14  tigital

	* YUV works better: but it's about half the width resolution as it
	  should be...at least it's not green ;-)

2004-05-03 02:08  tigital

	* removed void to shut up gcc

2004-05-03 01:42  tigital

	* YUV processing functions correctly now

2004-04-29 05:55  cclepper

	* YUV smoothing now works

2004-04-27 05:07  tigital

	* YUV works better, except for "smooth" line filling

2004-04-24 15:02  zmoelnig

	* removed some more verbosity...

2004-04-23 14:41  zmoelnig

	* moved some fsaa-code from apple-only to openGL-dependent code
	  (read: changed ifdefs)

2004-04-21 04:32  tigital

	* YUV is almost fixed: at least we're dealing with true luma...but
	  there still seems to be a pixel skipping problem

2004-04-21 03:52  cclepper

	* changed GetLuminance() coefficients to correct vaules

2004-04-20 17:55  zmoelnig

	* fixed the default viewpoint-values to the correct ones "0 0 4"
	  instead of "0 0 -4"

2004-04-10 00:13  tigital

	* [OSX] added header for definition of UInt32 after the mass
	  movement of functions

2004-04-09 09:38  zmoelnig

	* added the [pix_texture2]-alias again.
	  why has it vanished ?

2004-04-08 12:20  zmoelnig

	* moved utility functions (namely: powerOfTwo()) into
	  Base/GemFuncUtil

2004-04-08 11:57  zmoelnig

	* moved utility functions (namely: powerOfTwo()) into
	  Base/GemFuncUtil

2004-04-08 11:54  zmoelnig

	* structured the location of functions a bit:
	  GemPixObj does not hold any utility functions
	  GemFuncUtil holds general untilities (like powerOfTwo())
	  GemPixUtil holds utility functions for image manipulation (only!)
	  GemPixPete (NEW) holds functions from pete's_plugins (specialzied
	  PixUtil-functions)

2004-04-08 11:51  zmoelnig

	* added some comments

2004-04-08 11:51  zmoelnig

	* moved utility functions (namely: powerOfTwo()) into
	  Base/GemFuncUtil

2004-04-08 11:46  zmoelnig

	* added setPixModified() where apropriate so that the
	  pull-mechanism works

2004-04-08 11:43  zmoelnig

	* removed the [pix_buf] entirely from the example-patches.
	  i must have been somewhere else when i added them

	* removed unused variables

2004-04-07 17:33  zmoelnig

2004-04-07 17:20  zmoelnig

	* fixed the alpha-channel

2004-04-07 17:20  zmoelnig

	* added some more verbosity on errors (so we know, where the error
	  occured)

2004-04-07 16:09  tigital

	* quick n'dirty camera help patch...will flesh out tonight?

2004-04-07 16:08  zmoelnig

	* fixed the bug that kept cs-converters from working on apple

2004-04-07 16:07  zmoelnig

	* removed unused variable G

2004-04-07 16:04  tigital

	* added YUV support (kinda): it works, but isn't precisely correct
	  yet (especially in pix_objects that are color based; displacement
	  objects are less-obviously incorrect)

2004-04-07 16:02  tigital

	* added YUV support (kinda): it works, but isn't precisely correct
	  yet

2004-04-07 14:47  zmoelnig

	* added switchable support for FSAA under linux with nvidia-cards

2004-04-07 14:03  zmoelnig

	  render() (this was default on macOS already)

2004-04-07 14:01  zmoelnig

	* removed verbose output

2004-04-07 14:00  zmoelnig

	* added US-english alias-name ("gray")

2004-04-07 11:19  zmoelnig

	* an example for texture-feedbacking

2004-04-07 11:09  zmoelnig

	* added 2nd argument for number of slices
	  fixed the draw-type

2004-04-07 11:08  zmoelnig

	* added second argument (number of slices)
	  the re-creation of the sphere is now triggered by a change in
	  state->texture too

2004-04-07 10:28  zmoelnig

	* the processGray tried to convert the image from RGB to RGBA
	  in-place.
	  i have no idea, how this code made it into the [pix_alpha]

2004-04-07 09:12  zmoelnig

	* removed the non-mac specific part in the fullscreen-message
	  (no one really cares if the fullscreen-flag is bool or int)

2004-04-07 09:03  zmoelnig

	* all the CPPExtern-objects now no their own class-name, which is
	  stored in m_objectname
	  error-messages report this name

2004-04-06 02:43  tigital

	* [OSX] cleaned up warnings and consolidated a previously used
	  function

2004-04-05 03:06  cclepper

	* removed commenting out of m_colorspace

2004-04-04 17:45  cclepper

	* client_storage is now off by default to avoid texture corruption
	  problems when using pix_film in 'auto 1' mode on OSX. setting
	  individual frames still works fine with client_storage however.

2004-04-04 17:43  cclepper

	* added OSX specific handling of the 'fullscreen' message to
	  accommodate multiple displays

2004-04-03 18:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed the help-patches (mainly removed the "auto 1" message from
	  [pix_buf] as it was absolutely non-sense

2004-04-03 00:06  cclepper

	* removed most of the debug messages.

2004-04-02 23:29  cclepper

	* now has functioning code on OSX

2004-04-02 09:11  zmoelnig

2004-04-02 09:05  zmoelnig

	* moved implementation code from header-file to cpp-file

2004-04-02 09:04  zmoelnig

	* fixed some includes (?)

2004-04-02 06:43  zmoelnig

	* included the Base/config.h so we get the HAVE_DIRECTSHOW define
	  when appropriate
	  set the help-symbol of the directshow-version of pix_video to
	  [pix_videoDS] (since the api is so different)

2004-04-01 22:00  tigital

	* [OSX] now the mouse can be hidden/shown via the cursor 0/1
	  message

2004-04-01 18:52  tigital

	* [OSX] finally figure out how to get mouse coords to be the same
	  whether or not there is a title bar, and no matter where the
	  window is on the desktop...also solves the "go to {0,0} when
	  mouse leaves window" problem!

2004-03-31 05:33  tigital

	* shut up a warning: can't have /* inside a comment

2004-03-31 05:25  tigital

	* [OSX] shut up some warnings

2004-03-29 18:57  zmoelnig

	* i guess we should release rather sooner than later

2004-03-29 18:48  zmoelnig

	* finally removed the YUV-stuff (should have been done for ages)

2004-03-29 18:45  zmoelnig

	* fixed line-breaks

2004-03-29 18:32  zmoelnig

	* re-added as binary (pd-files shouldn't be text)

2004-03-29 18:32  zmoelnig

	* readded as binary

2004-03-29 18:32  zmoelnig

	* added as binary

2004-03-29 18:32  zmoelnig

	* removed "text"-pd files (should be binary)

2004-03-29 18:11  zmoelnig

	* new help-patch

2004-03-29 16:10  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-03-29 16:09  zmoelnig

	* compiled under windoze and thus updated my project-file

	* removed unneeded variables to shut down macOS-gcc

2004-03-29 16:02  zmoelnig

	* accidentially the button-state was reported to be "1" when
	  released (like on press); fixed

2004-03-29 16:01  zmoelnig

	* type change to get rid of compiler-warning under macOS

2004-03-29 16:00  zmoelnig

	* compiled it and therefore updated my project files

2004-03-29 06:43  zmoelnig

	* added includes for NT

2004-03-29 06:12  cclepper

	* changed the render function to only calculate the geometry when
	  the geometry changes. results in at least a 3X speedup.

2004-03-26 06:40  cclepper

	* initialized the Y,U,V variables to 0. no more random color fields
	  on loading a patch with pix_offset.

2004-03-25 19:57  tigital

	* [OSX]-only: standardized mouse location to "window relative":
	  however, remember that (0,0) is always the top left corner,
	  whether or not there is a title bar/border

2004-03-25 17:22  zmoelnig

	* added a magic-number to the GemCache to ensure that the cache is
	  valid

2004-03-25 12:12  zmoelnig

	* initialize GemCache on creation, so we can dynamically create
	  [gemhead]s and they will start rendering without having to
	  restart the engine

2004-03-25 10:03  zmoelnig

	* removed another post()

2004-03-24 21:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the "drawing all groups" messages

2004-03-24 21:10  zmoelnig

	* added a reset()-method to re-set an instance without having to
	  destroy and re-create it (see [gemhead])

2004-03-24 21:08  zmoelnig

	* each gemhead now has an instance of the GemCache that is only
	  reset when rendering is started (instead of being destroyed and
	  re-created)
	  hopefully this fixes some memory bug.

2004-03-24 17:27  zmoelnig

	* added, since needed for debugging

2004-03-24 13:20  zmoelnig

	* fixed initial materials (ambient, specular, diffuse, shininess,
	  emission)

2004-03-24 11:47  zmoelnig

	* added auto-(re)loading of fonts when rendering is started
	  fixed some cleanup-issues

2004-03-24 11:41  zmoelnig

	* removed "done" message

2004-03-22 22:31  tigital

	* [OSX]-only: [gemwin] now correctly responds to the following
	  messages: border & title; also fixed keyboard character input for
	  [gemkeyname]

2004-03-21 19:58  zmoelnig

	* readded help-patches

2004-03-21 19:53  zmoelnig

	  now, we can have 1000s of control points in polygon/curve)

2004-03-19 15:01  zmoelnig

	* new help-patches (e.g: working examples)

2004-03-19 15:00  zmoelnig

	* added a method "width" for the linewidth (compatibility with
	  other geos)

2004-03-19 14:58  zmoelnig

	* changed the helpsymbol

2004-03-19 14:54  zmoelnig

	* got the mapping from mac-buttons to gem-buttons right (hopefully)

2004-03-19 11:47  zmoelnig

	* randF is only an alias for randomF; there shouldn't be a separate
	  help-file

2004-03-18 16:51  zmoelnig

	* the mac-spefific button-offset has been moved to GemWinCreateMac

2004-03-17 20:04  zmoelnig

	* force auto-registering when appropriate

2004-03-17 20:02  zmoelnig

	* set the "newfilm"-flag when a new film is loaded

2004-03-17 19:58  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix rectangle textures

2004-03-16 19:41  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix rectangle textures

2004-03-16 01:16  tigital

	* OSX only: forgot to "return noErr" in event loop!

2004-03-15 13:35  zmoelnig

	* small bug-fix: a unity gain of "1" was translated to 255>>8
	  (which is less than 1 and led to fading feed-backs)

2004-03-13 09:10  cclepper

	* fixed #ifdefs

2004-03-10 17:32  zmoelnig

	* changed the configure-process
	  GemLibs can now be specified with "--gemlibs"
	  additional search-paths for ALL libraries can be specified with
	  "--libdir"

2004-03-10 17:07  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'd the altivec code with __VEC__

2004-03-10 17:06  zmoelnig

	* added the HELPSYMBOL-BASE "Gem/", so the help-patches will work,
	  even though this object inherits from CPPExtern and not from
	  GemBase

2004-03-10 16:55  zmoelnig

	* pix_depot and friends are now in pix_buffer et al.

2004-03-10 16:04  zmoelnig

	* added a new justification "BASE" that does no justification at
	  all; usefull, if you want a constant base-line.

2004-03-07 18:49  cclepper

	* new fullscreen code for 10.3 which is good. the window deletion
	  routine does crash every 10-20 iterations though, which is bad.

2004-03-01 01:29  cclepper

	* added some more cache hints - 45% percent faster

2004-03-01 01:02  cclepper

	* I think this fixes the majority of playback problems on OSX.
	  Movie loading is faster, playback is smoother using 'rate $1'.

2004-03-01 00:58  cclepper

	* just a cleaning

2004-03-01 00:55  cclepper

	* slightly tweaked Altivec (load hoisting)

2004-03-01 00:52  cclepper

	* added some Altivec for YUV

2004-03-01 00:50  cclepper

	* slightly better altivec.

2004-02-29 05:24  cclepper

	* an improved window bounds fix. still need to find a workaround
	  for the fullscreen on 10.3 though

2004-02-25 06:25  cclepper

	* split processing into RGBA and YUV portions. added Altivec for
	  YUV.

2004-02-16 19:07  zmoelnig

	* added path-searching for fonts.
	  so you can add your systems favorite font-path and get a lot of
	  other TrueType-faces

2004-02-16 04:06  cclepper

	* changed float to int processing in the YUV code - now 10X faster.

2004-02-15 18:32  cclepper

	* this should fix the window bounds problem.

2004-02-13 14:09  zmoelnig

	* hopefully got the reference-types allright ("relative" instead of
	  "absolute")

2004-02-13 14:06  zmoelnig

	* updated my project

2004-02-12 17:31  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug with filename-searching

2004-02-12 17:28  zmoelnig

	* added better support for firewire under linux (thanks to franz
	  hildgen)

2004-02-12 17:25  zmoelnig

	* fixed a type that prevented this from being compiled

2004-02-10 12:36  zmoelnig

	* now the gemwindow can be created even if we only have DirectColor
	  (instead of TrueColor); however i haven't bothered yet with
	  setting up the Palettes.

2004-02-10 12:27  zmoelnig

	* added a newline at end of file

2004-02-10 12:24  zmoelnig

	* more friendly output of the "create window" message

2004-02-10 10:47  zmoelnig

	* - added ErrorHandling, so Gem doesn't crash if the
	  display-/window-context has vanished before we try to destroy the
	  gemwindow
	  - removed checking for ModLines on remote displays; this used to
	  crash; unfortunately this disables fullscreen on remote displays

2004-02-10 10:23  zmoelnig

	* added and disabled Guenter at the splash-screen (again)

2004-02-06 12:10  zmoelnig

	* BUGFIX: used to crash when no model was loaded and trying to
	  apply a texture.
	  (at least if NDEBUG was not defined)

2004-02-06 12:08  zmoelnig

	* as ben has pointed out, there seems to be a bug when rendering to
	  non-square windows: everything get's distorted (say: on 640x480 a
	  square would be a rectangle with a 4/3-aspect);
	  since i think this might break a lot of things (?), i have left
	  the old default behaviour but you can turn off compatibility with
	  "compat 0"

2004-02-05 18:17  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc-project
	  it now compiles with FTGL

2004-02-05 18:16  zmoelnig

	* moved the defines for the platforms (e.g: whether macos uses
	  FTGL) into the appropriate config*.h files

2004-02-02 11:19  zmoelnig

	* all docu is done; but we need to compile it under windows with
	  FTGL support (i failed...)

2004-02-02 11:18  zmoelnig

	* updated my project

2004-02-02 11:15  zmoelnig

	* put QT-loader *after* the AVI-loader, because QT sometimes
	  crashes when having loaded AVI's and tries to load QT's
	  afterwards.
	  so AVI is now handled by the built in (for win) routines, and
	  QuickTime is only used if it fails

2004-02-02 11:13  zmoelnig

	* post "video4linux" and remove post of "fish" ;-)

2004-02-02 11:12  zmoelnig

	* added some support for devices not handled by devfs;
	  added upside-down flag
	  decode RGBA by hand (since otherwise we would decode
	  YUV->RGB->RGBA, all in software...)

2004-02-02 11:11  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed the inclusion of m_pd.h to make sure it is not included
	  double (breaks with old version of pd)

2004-02-02 11:08  zmoelnig

	* exported the CVector class, since vc complaint about this
	  (probably this will break future things...)

2004-02-02 11:06  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed fromUYVY since it did mix up U and V when
	  decoding dv-streams

2004-02-02 11:04  zmoelnig

	* fixed types to keep compiler silent

2004-02-02 11:03  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed everything to be __APPLE__ only

2004-01-31 06:55  cclepper

	* new pix_movie for OSX. uses an optimized path for movie playing
	  and texturing.

2004-01-29 01:59  tigital

	* initialized variables to shutup compiler warnings

2004-01-28 16:06  tigital

	* OSX only: added carbon event processing to
	  dispatchGemWindowMessages() (Finally!)

2004-01-28 16:03  tigital

	* added mouse wheel support, though there is no outlet (yet)

2004-01-28 15:59  tigital

	* added mouse wheel support
	  OSX only: added support for correct mouse buttons

2004-01-28 15:54  tigital

	* OSX only: added event handler support for window, mouse and
	  keyboard events (ie. [gemmouse] and [gemkeyboard]), plus the
	  window now behaves in a standard gui manner

2004-01-28 04:46  cclepper

	* fixed a little problem with newImage being multiply defined

2004-01-27 17:13  zmoelnig

	* re-removed them (somehow they reappeared in the CVS; guess it has
	  to do with sourceforge's server-sync)

2004-01-21 16:50  zmoelnig

	* added support for rectangle textures even with sphereMaps
	  ("texture 1")

2004-01-20 08:14  cclepper

	* added support for rectangle textures to glm

2004-01-09 10:32  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc-project

2004-01-09 10:31  zmoelnig

	* updated fixed bugs

2004-01-09 05:09  tigital

	* values should be "TimeValue", not int's (shuts up compiler
	  warnings)

2004-01-09 04:27  tigital

	* added (int *) casts to fscanf() calls to shutup compiler (someone
	  had to do it!)

2004-01-08 19:16  zmoelnig

	* hmm: probably new linebreaks

2004-01-08 19:07  zmoelnig

	* YUV-support fixed (the image looks "different" (squashed) than
	  RGBA, but at least it is functional and not crashing any more),
	  Grayscale works great

2004-01-08 19:03  zmoelnig

	* i think, all objects are documented (somehow: some help-patches
	  are rather crude)

2004-01-08 19:02  zmoelnig

	* several BUG-fixes (esp: put the pivot-point of rubber/ripple into
	  the center; made the sizeMess-work; use normalized coordinates
	  for rubber (now independent of the window-dimensions)

2004-01-08 18:59  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-01-05 19:14  zmoelnig

	* updated docs

2004-01-05 19:08  zmoelnig

	* use a movie rather than an image for demonstrating this

2004-01-05 18:37  zmoelnig

	* added newImage-variable since it was needed

2004-01-05 18:35  zmoelnig

	* removed a debug message

2004-01-05 18:34  zmoelnig

	* added an include for windows

2004-01-05 18:20  zmoelnig

	* re-added inlets for height, size and mode
	  transformed and scaled the newWave so that it behaves exactly
	  like a square of the same dimension when there is no motion.
	  
	  ASK: why is this "blend" function in there ?

2004-01-05 11:08  zmoelnig

	* better checks for pd-version

2004-01-05 10:18  zmoelnig

	* glu-objects (like sphere) have a bit of a problem with
	  non-power-of-2 textures

2004-01-05 09:58  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-01-05 09:42  zmoelnig

	* my project-builder project has been updated

2004-01-05 09:41  zmoelnig

	* updated doc

2004-01-05 09:28  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos

2004-01-05 09:23  zmoelnig

	* use integer calcs rather than floating point

2004-01-04 18:56  zmoelnig

	* bugfix (videoV4L crashed when you tried to open a non-existant
	  device)

2004-01-04 18:53  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the pd-version (because of reference
	  install-paths)

2004-01-04 18:51  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2003-12-31 02:55  cclepper

	* added support for groups

2003-12-31 02:49  cclepper

	* yet another rewrite of the QT tasking code. this should hopefully
	  give the 'best of both worlds'.

2003-12-17 06:21  cclepper

	* added the real frame counting method and made improvements to
	  using the counter method of playback - no double processed frames

2003-12-17 06:13  tigital

	* rearranged variables to shut up gcc 3.3 about initialization

2003-12-17 06:13  tigital

	* removed unused vector to shut up gcc 3.3

2003-12-17 06:11  tigital

	* added Cyrille's changes: now it's more controllable (and useful):
	  see examples/07.texture/05.newWave.pd

2003-12-17 06:05  tigital

	* added Cyrille's changes: now it's more controllable (and useful):
	  see examples/07.texture/05.newWave.pd

2003-12-12 18:21  zmoelnig

	* dos2unix -- linebreaks

2003-12-10 02:18  cclepper

	* rewrite to make playback using 'auto' more efficient. 'rate'
	  message sets the playback speed when using 'auto' mode. the movie
	  rate is properly set for correct qt playback. new doDebug for
	  handling internal state info display to the console.

2003-12-08 06:02  cclepper

	* added hiquality message to deal with DV streams (yeah i know it's
	  ass backwards to disable hiquality to make DV streams look good)

2003-12-07 02:47  cclepper

	* changed internal texture format back to RGBA so now alpha works
	  in textures

2003-12-06 05:04  cclepper

	* default is now set to YUV colorspace

2003-12-04 17:57  zmoelnig

	* new help-patch from cyrille

2003-12-04 17:53  zmoelnig

	* reviewed help-patches

2003-12-04 13:18  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: one additional inlet was created for [primTri], [curve]
	  and [polygon] by GemShape.
	  i have added a new creator for GemShape (without arguments) that
	  will not create the "size"-inlet - this is for objects that want
	  only the "draw" and "width" message

2003-12-04 12:19  zmoelnig

	* the bugfix for Grey-support needs a header-file too...

2003-12-03 13:21  zmoelnig

	* BUGFIX: grayscale was missing

2003-12-03 07:18  cclepper

	* made client_storage a user defined option. this is a temporary
	  workaround to some texture corruption issues.

2003-12-02 15:26  zmoelnig

	* my new windows-project

2003-12-02 15:26  zmoelnig

	* filed YUV-bug of pix_kaleidoscope

2003-12-02 15:22  zmoelnig

	* added dummy messages for "enumerate" and "dialog" (used by
	  pix_videoDS, in the future probably by others...)

2003-12-02 15:21  zmoelnig

	* "dialog" with no args is now the same as "setup" ("setup" message
	  should be deprecated)

2003-12-02 15:20  zmoelnig

	* added dummy messages for "enumerate" and "dialog" (used by
	  pix_videoDS)

2003-12-02 15:19  zmoelnig

	* upside down

2003-12-02 15:18  zmoelnig

	* support for colour-space switching

2003-12-02 15:18  zmoelnig

	* use __NEW_FILM rather than __NEW__

2003-12-02 15:17  zmoelnig

	* colourspace-switching with GL_* rather than 0 (YUV) and 1 (RGBA)

2003-12-02 15:16  zmoelnig

	* a bit of support for colourspace-switching

2003-12-02 15:15  zmoelnig

	* made it a bit more stable on windos

2003-12-02 15:14  zmoelnig

	* added some braces to make execution order clearer

2003-12-02 14:57  zmoelnig

	* split __NEW__ in __VIDEO_NEW and __FILM_NEW

2003-12-02 06:36  cclepper

	* changed in to GLint to match prototype of csMess

2003-12-02 05:38  cclepper

	* fixed error in code - it now compiles

2003-12-01 14:48  zmoelnig

	* once in a while i compile under NT...

2003-12-01 14:47  zmoelnig

	* configLinux.h should be generated for all machines by the
	  configure-script.
	  don't know, how this came into the CVS

2003-12-01 14:27  zmoelnig

	* another bug fixed for NT

2003-12-01 14:19  zmoelnig

	* rebuilt configure to add the "-l" flags

2003-12-01 14:05  zmoelnig

	* rebuilt it with another version of "aclocal"

2003-12-01 13:55  zmoelnig

	* another bugfix (pix_videoDS) reported

2003-12-01 13:52  zmoelnig

	* updated bugfixes ("create" on remote X-servers works for most but
	  my machine)

2003-12-01 13:48  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: configure wouldn't add "-l" flags for "standard"
	  libraries found with AC_FIND_LIB

2003-12-01 10:09  zmoelnig

	* removed swapMess() and dimenMess() - should be handled by the
	  parent-class
	  
	  removed explicit-call to the parent's setupCallback; should be
	  handled via CPPExtern.
	  
	  turned on capturing for device 0 by default.
	  
	  Callback() now returns NOERROR instead of S_FALSE: i don't know
	  why we would want to stop grabbing::i only got 1 frame and it
	  stopped; now i can grab moving images !
	  messages:
	  
	  the pixBlock-array is now called m_pixBlockBuf[];
	  m_pixBlock is another pixBlock that gets the data on "render()"
	  via fromBGR().
	  LATER: add other functions to let users select the color-space
	  via the setup-dialog
	  
	  added a "colorspace" message, that sets the output-colorspace
	  (not the capturing one!)
	  
	  made the "device" message an alias for "open" (because of
	  compatibility to pix_videoNEW)
	  made the "dialog"-message (without arguments) an alias for
	  "setup", because this gives us one (1) interface to
	  popup-dialogs.
	  
	  LATER: make "dimen", "norm", "channel" work

2003-12-01 09:59  zmoelnig

	* changed the m_colorspace, to not only be 0 (for YUV) and 1(for
	  RGBA) but rather GL_YCBCR422_GEM and GL_RGBA

2003-12-01 09:56  zmoelnig

	* if we HAVE_DIRECTSHOW, we disable the AUTO_REGISTER stuff, if(!)
	  DO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS is not defined.
	  pix_videoDS will define the DO_AUTO..., to register itself
	  
	  this is *very* ugly
	  LATER rethink this

2003-12-01 09:52  zmoelnig

	* removed offsetMess() and swapMess(); should be handled by the
	  parent-class
	  use fromBGR() rather than doing it by hand. this enables other
	  color-spaces too!
	  added a colorspace-message

2003-12-01 09:50  zmoelnig

	* changed the configure a bit to make more intelligent searches in
	  the search-paths, for both libs and headers
	  we now search /usr/local/src and /usr/local/include instead of
	  whole /usr/local (at least for headers)

2003-11-28 18:19  ggeiger

	* fixed alpha depthtest default value

2003-11-25 17:38  zmoelnig

	* support for different colour-spaces

2003-11-25 17:38  zmoelnig

	* support for different colour-spaces (use "colorspace"-message)

2003-11-25 16:54  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat() instead of doing this by hand
	  also there is now a m_reqFormat defining the colourspace (but
	  only GL_RGBA is supported....)

2003-11-25 16:52  zmoelnig

	* setCsizeByFormat now also sets the "type" (pixel alignment)
	  on __APPLE__ the default is yuv, everywhere else it is rgba

2003-11-25 16:51  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat instead of doing it by hand

2003-11-25 16:29  zmoelnig

	* fixed a stupid bug, that was blacking the "last" buffer each
	  cycle.
	  added object-arguments as initial parameters
	  take care of colorspace-changes

2003-11-25 15:16  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is not defined
	  exclude "Base/config.h" since it is already included by film.h

2003-11-25 15:14  zmoelnig

	* set the helpsymbol to "pix_film" instead of "pix_filmNEW"
	  uncommented the use of canvas_getfilename since it makes problems
	  with internet-streams (as far as i remember)

2003-11-25 15:09  zmoelnig

	* moved the disabling of auto-register to pix_video.h

2003-11-25 15:07  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things)

2003-11-25 15:06  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the "colorspace"-callback

2003-11-25 15:05  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is defined

2003-11-25 15:04  zmoelnig

	* set the help-symbol to "pix_movie" (instead of "pix_movieNEW")

2003-11-25 15:03  zmoelnig

	* moved the disabling of auto-register to pix_video.h

2003-11-25 15:02  zmoelnig

	* set the help-symbol to "pix_video" (instead of "pix_videoNEW")

2003-11-25 15:01  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is not defined

2003-11-25 14:59  zmoelnig

	* used setBlack() instead of memset(); use reallocate()

2003-11-25 14:57  zmoelnig

	* setting newfilm to 0 (shouldn't do anything since we are on linux
	  (?))

2003-11-25 14:55  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things)
	  exclude "GemBase.h" and use "m_pd.h" instead (shouldn't be needed
	  either, if it wasn't for post())

2003-11-25 14:54  zmoelnig

	* get more information
	  the last outlet (data) is still the last outlet (but now there
	  are 6 instead of 4). this shouldn't break anything, since who can
	  do something with it ?

2003-11-25 14:53  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things)

2003-11-25 14:51  zmoelnig

	* added "--disable-new" for "old" behaviour with pix_film/pix_video
	  and friends under linux
	  this the config.h.in for linux-autoconf has moved to
	  configLinux.h.in

2003-11-25 14:48  zmoelnig

	* made config.h system-independent.
	  this the config.h.in for linux-autoconf has moved to
	  configLinux.h.in

2003-11-25 14:46  zmoelnig

	* made config.h system-independent.
	  the system-bound configurations are stored in separate files
	  (like Base/configLinux.h) which are included by config.h
	  (depending on __linux__ and friends)

2003-11-25 14:43  zmoelnig

	* initialized newfilm/newimage to 0

2003-11-25 14:41  zmoelnig

	* added support for HELPSYMBOL_BASE (which is defined as "Gem/") --
	  used in CPPExtern.h

2003-11-25 14:41  zmoelnig

	* added HELPSYMBOL to set an alternate helpsymbol (it crashes, when
	  more than 1 help-symbols are specified and we already do it here)
	  added support for HELPSYMBOL_BASE (which is defined as "Gem/" in
	  GemBase.h)

2003-11-23 19:27  zmoelnig

	* set notowned=false when color-conversion is done (which is the
	  truth)

2003-11-19 08:53  zmoelnig

	* this is my macOS-projectmaker-project

2003-11-18 19:53  zmoelnig

	* help-patches for [curve3d] and [tube]

2003-11-18 18:21  zmoelnig

	* changed "post()" to "debug()" which is a define to either
	  "post()" or nothing, so we can do some debug-information on
	  demand

2003-11-18 18:18  zmoelnig

	* removed the auto-registering

2003-11-18 18:12  zmoelnig

	* added an alias for "colorspace"-message

2003-11-18 17:47  cclepper

	* new pbproj

2003-11-18 15:39  zmoelnig

	* made XWin be aware of resizes.
	  however, it doesn't really work yet :-(

2003-11-18 15:36  zmoelnig

	* added MIN and MAX functions

2003-11-18 15:25  zmoelnig

	* added curve3d and tube

2003-11-18 15:21  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2003-11-18 15:20  zmoelnig

	* removed unneeded variables

2003-11-18 15:18  zmoelnig

	* include "config.h" only on linux
	  note: this should be changed LATER to include "config.h" on all
	  platforms.
	  config.h should then include platform-specific config-files (that
	  can be generated with configure or whatever)

2003-11-18 15:17  zmoelnig

	* defined NO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS to not register this class with pd
	  on __linux__, __APPLE__ and NT

2003-11-18 15:14  zmoelnig

	* put the auto_register code in a separate define whichcan be
	  switched off by defining NO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS before including
	  the CPPExtern.h

2003-11-17 18:53  zmoelnig

	* swapped 2 variables in class-definition (apple's gcc likes it
	  better this way)
	  removed unused code

2003-11-15 03:26  cclepper

	* added Altivec function for both RGB and YUV

2003-11-14 14:43  zmoelnig

	* added curve3d and tube

2003-11-14 10:26  zmoelnig

	* added scaling for the mouse-coordinates.
	  this allows output that is independant of the window-size

2003-11-14 07:21  cclepper

	* removed the extraneous RGB_Altivec prototype

2003-11-14 07:19  cclepper

	* a dst tweak and bug fix

2003-11-13 04:26  cclepper

	* slight change to RGB vector code

2003-11-13 03:39  cclepper

	* added Altivec

2003-11-12 18:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the check, whether the first atom of the text-list is a
	  symbol. now we can print numbers too.

2003-11-12 17:57  zmoelnig

	* changed processRGB_Altivec to processRGBA_Altivec

2003-11-12 17:55  zmoelnig

	* fixed linefeed

2003-11-11 07:31  cclepper

2003-11-10 02:14  cclepper

	* changed Altivec defines

2003-11-03 12:15  zmoelnig

	* changed (bool) to (int), since vc6 doesn't like assigning a
	  boolean-value to an integer.

2003-11-03 12:14  zmoelnig

	* added no-warn-flags for vc6

2003-11-03 12:13  zmoelnig

	* made it compile with ffmpeg-0.4.8 (however i wasn't yet able to
	  load a movie...)

2003-11-03 12:12  zmoelnig

	* made it work under windows; however it likes crashing sometimes
	  and i haven't found out yet why...

2003-10-24 18:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed some BUGS...

2003-10-24 18:32  zmoelnig

	* added "--with-aviplay" as an alias for "--with-avi"

2003-10-24 18:31  zmoelnig

	* added some comment to the render() for neither FTGL/GLTT support
	  (while trying to find out

2003-10-23 08:10  zmoelnig

	* fixed another possible bug (check for NULL-images)

2003-10-22 11:01  zmoelnig

	* added the self-registering code, so that MarkEx will stay
	  available

2003-10-22 09:06  zmoelnig

	* further changes, but far from working yet

2003-10-22 08:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed bugs in pix_buffer_read/pix_buffer_write when no or unknown
	  pix_buffers were specifified

2003-10-22 08:34  zmoelnig

	* added "fsaa" to the WindowHints-class

2003-10-22 05:34  cclepper

	* added FSAA

2003-10-21 18:15  ggeiger

	* remove setup() function this is done through a static class
	  structure now, that is created for each object
	  Gem objects are added automatically to pd as soon as they are
	  compiled in

2003-10-21 18:14  ggeiger

	* re-used continueRender() function

2003-10-21 18:13  ggeiger

	* removed my name from startup

2003-10-21 14:44  ggeiger

	* distribute particles according to their velocity if there is more
	  than one particle per frame

2003-10-21 14:21  ggeiger

	* added numberbox to rotate light (cube seems to be very dark with
	  180)

2003-10-21 14:19  ggeiger

	* added auto message description

2003-10-21 14:17  ggeiger

	* change is in pd already

2003-10-21 13:50  ggeiger

	* bang on gemhead triggers a render cycle (was broken)

2003-10-15 19:07  zmoelnig

	* set the upside-down flag to true. (hope this is alright)

2003-10-15 19:05  zmoelnig

	* temporarily added some variables (like m_auto)
	  these should be gone when i really have access to a machine where
	  quicktime4win is installed

2003-10-15 19:04  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug when searching for the linker/compiler flags for
	  libavifile:
	  not "avifile-config" is used if available

2003-10-15 19:03  zmoelnig

	* new bugs (pix_buffer, libavifile, remote display)

2003-10-10 12:52  zmoelnig

	* added filmQT
	  changed "#define DEBUG" to "#define debug"

2003-10-10 12:16  zmoelnig

	* disabled pete's "static"-hack with NO_HACK (default on windows)

2003-10-10 12:12  zmoelnig

	* vc6 doesn't like statical arrays with variable sizes

2003-10-10 11:15  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc6-projects

2003-10-10 11:14  zmoelnig

	* disabled warnings on vc6

2003-10-10 11:13  zmoelnig

	* search for libavifile-headers rather than assuming they are in
	  /usr/include/avifile

2003-10-10 11:11  zmoelnig

	* first attempt of a port from [pix_filmQT] to the film*-class.
	  however i have quicktime4windows not installed, so i had no way
	  to compile this yet....

2003-10-10 11:10  zmoelnig

	* made filmAVI work.
	  a first step for pix_filmNEW to run on windows...

2003-10-10 11:09  zmoelnig

	* for libavifile we used to include <avifile/avifile.h>;
	  since the headers for libavifile-0.7 is located in
	  /usr/include/avifile-0.7/, we now search for the correct path in
	  the "configure" and include only "avifile.h"

2003-10-10 11:07  zmoelnig

	* <unistd.h> is only included if HAVE_LIBAVIPLAY is defined

2003-10-10 11:04  zmoelnig

	* removed "m_film", since it is not needed

2003-10-10 11:03  zmoelnig

	* my vc6-dos-compiler doesn't like <iostream> because it makes it
	  like against some "new" io-libs while it rather needs "old" ones
	  which are requested by <iostream.h>

2003-10-10 11:02  zmoelnig

	* commented out namespace std for windows (vc6 complained about
	  this)

2003-10-10 11:00  zmoelnig

	* now you see something after the first coordinate-change...

2003-10-10 10:59  zmoelnig

	* now using [pix_buf] instead of re-loading the image for each
	  blending-change

2003-10-08 17:33  zmoelnig

	* removed the [pix_rgba], since now [pix_film] should output only
	  RGBA/YUV/Grayscale

2003-10-08 16:55  zmoelnig

	* reported bugfix of filmQT4L

2003-10-08 16:54  zmoelnig

	* this is how [pix_movie] looks like if derived from [pix_filmNEW]
	  (and [pix_texture])

2003-10-08 16:51  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct;
	  added YUV support

2003-10-08 16:09  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct;

2003-10-08 16:06  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct;
	  added this flag to setTexCoords() to indicate whether the
	  texture-coordinates should be flipped or not.
	  the __APPLE__ define for flipping is therefore obsoleted.

2003-10-08 16:04  zmoelnig

	* added "upsidedown" to imageStruct;
	  this is meant for texture-flipping of the image (most movies are
	  loaded the "wrong" way)
	  upsidedown defaults to true on __APPLE__; false elsewhere

2003-10-08 15:01  zmoelnig

	* made [pix_movieNEW] (for now; of course this should [pix_movie]
	  LATER a friend of [pix_texture]
	  this will let us use the sophisticated texturing mechanism of
	  [pix_texture] for [pix_movie]

2003-10-07 16:10  zmoelnig

	* moved the pix_film things up a bit, because i had a hard time
	  making [pix_film] an alias for [pix_filmNEW]

2003-10-07 16:09  zmoelnig

	* added "colorspace"-method

2003-10-07 16:09  zmoelnig

	* some bug fixing
	  added "colorspace"-method
	  "post" becomes "DEBUG" which can be turned off.
	  some reordering of decode-libs: libmpeg3 is better in decoding
	  mpegs then libavifile (less crashes)

2003-10-07 15:47  zmoelnig

	* open() now utilizes setCsizeByFormat()

2003-10-07 15:46  zmoelnig

	* made the openStream sleep a bit. still opening streamed-files
	  sometimes crashes
	  added support for more colour-formats

2003-10-07 15:44  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.
	  the rest should be filled with defaults by the film-class.

2003-10-07 15:43  zmoelnig

	* added colour-change on the fly

2003-10-07 15:40  zmoelnig

	* open() now returns false (to make the skip to next api work)

2003-10-07 15:39  zmoelnig

	* requestColor() now sets "m_wantedFormat"

2003-10-07 15:38  zmoelnig

	* a bit of code-cleanup

2003-10-07 12:01  zmoelnig

	* rewrote a bit in the #ifdef clauses and put them all together.
	  it is really ugly
	  on linux pix_filmNEW is now the default

2003-10-07 11:47  zmoelnig

	* encapsuled everything but constructor/destructor within one big
	  "#ifdef HAVE_QT4L" (using inheritance)
	  made getFrame() return frames of all three colour-spaces.
	  fixed several bugs

2003-10-07 08:58  zmoelnig

	* encapsuled everything but constructor/destructor within one big
	  "#ifdef HAVE_QT4L" (using inheritance)
	  made getFrame() return frames of all three colour-spaces.
	  BAD: we only get RGB-images from the qt4l-library. this means:
	  video(YUV)->buffer(RGB)->gem_image(RGBA/YUV/Gray). but what
	  should i do ?

2003-10-07 08:55  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the getFrame() to:
	  a) get frames of different colour-spaces
	  b) decode YUV/Gray really fast (directly access the decoding
	  Y/U/V-planes)

2003-10-07 08:51  zmoelnig

	* added some thoughts about requested/forced colourspaces.
	  i think, that film* should at least return colour-spaces that
	  could be handled by Gem/openGL itself.
	  (it doesnt make sense for [pix_film] to handle IMG_FMT_RGB15)
	  so the cs-request should really be a force and not just a
	  suggestion

2003-10-07 08:46  zmoelnig

	* added fromRGB16() to retrieve data from 16bit encoded RGB.
	  added fromYV12(Y,U,V) which does not assume that the U and V
	  planes are directly after the Y plane. this is handy if we have
	  independent planes

2003-10-03 14:28  zmoelnig

	* GL_RGBA is not defined at openGL<1.2 (i think);
	  furthermore the include-check for CPPExtern.h is already made in
	  CPPExtern.h

2003-10-03 13:59  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.
	  the rest should be filled with defaults by the film-class.

2003-10-03 13:59  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.
	  the rest should be filled with defaults by the film-class.
	  on close() the filehandler is set to NULL (caused to crash on
	  multiple closes)

2003-10-02 14:47  zmoelnig

	* removed #include <OpenGL/gl.h> (it is included in GemBase anyhow)
	  ifdef'ed the #include <OpenGL/glu.h> to __APPLE__ (else <GL/gl.h>

2003-09-30 18:16  zmoelnig

	* filmQT4L procuces RGB if RGBA is not supported by the codec

2003-09-30 18:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the processRGBAImage-call (anyhow, it didn't do anything)

2003-09-30 18:11  zmoelnig

	* added YUV support
	  split processImage into processRGBAImage and processGrayImage

	* fixed "comparison between signed & unsigned int" warning on line
	  117, in processRGBAImage()

2003-09-24 04:33  tigital

	* replaced __APPLE__ define with macosx_math.h

2003-09-24 04:32  tigital

	* added default: break; to PAAvoid::Execute() & PABounce::Execute,
	  because PDPoint, PDLine, PDBox, PDCylinder, PDCone, and PDBlob
	  aren't taken care of...also replaced __APPLE__ defines with
	  macosx_math.h

2003-09-24 04:27  tigital

	* added default: break; to _pCallActionList(), because PAHeaderID
	  isn't taken care of

2003-09-23 03:21  tigital

	* added glFinish() & several glPixelStorei()'s for __APPLE__ for
	  speed up?: is this applicable to all platforms?

2003-09-23 03:16  tigital

	* removed unused variables

2003-09-23 02:50  tigital

2003-09-22 10:01  zmoelnig

	* added Gray-support
	  split the processImage into processRGBAImage and processGrayImage

2003-09-22 09:59  zmoelnig

	* added YUV-Support (like grayscale: the difference image is
	  written on the luma-channel; colour is discarded)

2003-09-22 09:58  zmoelnig

	* added Gray-support (RGBA & Gray are in processImage, while YUV
	  has a separate function)

2003-09-22 09:57  zmoelnig

	* added Gray-support

2003-09-22 09:55  zmoelnig

2003-09-11 10:54  zmoelnig

	* added a comment

2003-09-11 10:06  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed a bit on installing the examples for linux

2003-07-26 23:14  ggeiger

	* disable depth test for alpha blended render chains.
	  I think this is the correct way how alpha should work, still
	  there is
	  a message *auto* to turn it off

2003-07-22 19:16  zmoelnig

	* added postrender() hack, to prevent the "source-object" to be
	  drawn

2003-07-22 19:00  ggeiger

	* fix compilation bugs, removed ifdefs for ffmeg version

2003-07-22 18:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed the crash
	  however, this is very slow.
	  we'll have to write a faster routine ourselves

2003-07-22 18:27  zmoelnig

	* if m_interlace was 0, this used to crash my machine with a
	  floating-point exception.
	  thus "if(interleave<=0)interleave=1;"

2003-07-22 18:15  zmoelnig

	* removed the create/destroy/blank routines for the buffer

2003-07-22 18:14  zmoelnig

	* added checks before delete[] (just in case)

2003-07-22 08:36  zmoelnig

	* dos2unix (changed linefeed/carriage-returns)

2003-07-22 08:35  zmoelnig

	* removed empty functions for YUV/YUValtivec/Grey images
	  (why do we have classes ?)

2003-07-22 08:34  zmoelnig

	* removed functions for YUV/YUValtivec/Grey images
	  (why do we have classes ?)

2003-07-22 08:31  zmoelnig

	* removed functions for YUV/YUValtivec/Grey images
	  (why do we have classes ?)
	  added an include for <assert.h>, this might break compilation on
	  other platforms,
	  if so, please ifdef it to __linux__

2003-07-22 08:26  zmoelnig

	* added a newline at end of file ;-)

2003-07-22 07:45  zmoelnig

	  pix_grey and pix_yuv are childs of pix_rgba (reduces code
	  dramatically!)

	* fixed several bugs in the color-conversion routines

2003-07-21 07:51  dheck

2003-07-19 17:30  zmoelnig

	* general entry for pix-bugs

2003-07-19 16:36  zmoelnig

	  0.5 particles per rendering cycle)

2003-07-19 16:30  zmoelnig

	* model.cpp_ seems to have been committed to the CVS.
	  it was just a backup for work...

	* added FTGL-2.04 -- support

2003-07-16 05:17  tigital

2003-07-16 02:57  tigital

	* added PeteHelpers.h stuff (defines, inline functions)

2003-07-16 02:55  tigital

	* cleanup, changed to __APPLE__, solved casting problem

2003-07-15 16:26  zmoelnig

	* added support for grey and yuv images. (not tested)

2003-07-15 11:50  zmoelnig

	* added settable domains+arguments

2003-07-15 11:48  zmoelnig

	* [part_velcone] and [part_velsphere] are obsoleted by

	  [pix_buffer_write]

2003-07-15 07:55  zmoelnig

	* just render a video onto a geo

2003-07-15 07:53  zmoelnig

	* help for the resp. object

2003-07-15 07:39  cclepper

	* added checks for FTGL

2003-07-15 07:38  zmoelnig

	* added [part_vertex], [part_velocity], [part_veldomain]

2003-07-15 07:38  zmoelnig

	* [part_vertex] adds one particle each rendering cycle at a certain
	  position
	  -- useful for moving particle sources
	  (but alas, only one particle at a time)

2003-07-15 07:36  zmoelnig

	* [part_veldomain] sets the velocity into a specified domain (like
	  sphere, triangle or whatever)

2003-07-15 07:36  zmoelnig

	* [part_velocity] sets the velocity into a specified direction

2003-07-15 07:34  zmoelnig

	* include <iostream> rather than <iostream.h>

2003-07-15 07:32  zmoelnig

	* you can now set the domain of the source
	  TODO: make the argument vector settable too (not much use
	  without)

2003-07-15 07:30  zmoelnig

	* added a new object for extruded text (FTGL only)

2003-07-15 07:22  zmoelnig

	* added FTGL support for text-rendering
	  under macOS i have made FTGL the default (not knowing whether it
	  will break)
	  under windos GLTT is still the default (although FTGL should work
	  too)
	  under linux the configure script decides what to take, but
	  prefers FTGL rather than GLTT

2003-07-15 02:30  cclepper

	* added Altivec YUV function

2003-07-13 06:13  tigital

2003-07-11 14:58  zmoelnig

	* added a newline at the end of the file

2003-07-11 14:55  zmoelnig

	* got some problems with the cvs-update on another machine.
	  hope it's ok now

2003-07-11 14:06  zmoelnig

	* added checks for mmx-extension of gcc

2003-07-11 13:58  zmoelnig

	* filedescriptors may also be 0! i only closed the device, if the
	  fd was>0.
	  fixed.

2003-07-11 13:55  zmoelnig

	* added a flag to WindowInfo, whether a constant context has been
	  established.
	  the destroyWindow depends partly on this (because my laptop (with
	  an ati mobility l6) crashed when destroying a non-constant
	  context.
	  also changed the line "do not continue" to "continue at your own
	  risk"

2003-07-09 12:07  zmoelnig

	* added some advice for video1394 under linux

2003-07-09 11:17  zmoelnig

	* removed the Makefile.depend . they are not really needed in CVS

2003-07-09 10:59  zmoelnig

	* use image.reallocate() rather than image.clear() +
	  image.allocate()

2003-07-09 10:58  zmoelnig

	* it seems like this is only used under linux for now.
	  however, i have added the videoDV4L support.
	  and there is now a "driver" message, that let's you choose
	  between various drivers (like video4linux and video1394)
	  yes, the way the modules are registered is really BAD.
	  have to change this soon

2003-07-09 10:56  zmoelnig

	* hopefully this is a real support for video over ieee1394
	  (firewire/dv) under linux!

2003-07-09 10:51  zmoelnig

	* changed the error-message (like for setting the device) slightly

2003-07-09 10:43  zmoelnig

	* fixed the dv-checking.
	  force the headers to be there, when the library is found too

2003-07-09 10:41  zmoelnig

	* added some more yuv-conversions. (following a new naming-scheme
	  after the FOURCC)
	  fromUYVY, fromYUY2 (=YUYV), fromYVYU, fromYV12;
	  fromYUV422() is now an alias for fromUYVY()
	  fromYUV420P() is now an alias for fromYV12()

2003-06-23 06:58  cclepper

	* fixed Ian's prefetch code

2003-06-23 06:57  cclepper

	* fixed inaccurate estimation of film length, trying yet another
	  way to do getFrame()

2003-06-23 06:52  cclepper

	* added newfilm to state to tell when a film has been changed -
	  mostly for faster rectangle texturing at this point

2003-06-23 06:17  cclepper

	* improvements to YUV code

2003-06-23 06:11  cclepper

	* Added a Quicktime for Windows film loader.

2003-05-24 16:30  zmoelnig

	* shouldn't the "snap" message be replaced by a "bang". (at least i
	  have *add*ed it)

2003-05-24 16:27  zmoelnig

	* put the [pix_grey] back in again (why isn't it there ?)

2003-05-24 15:54  zmoelnig

	* added greyscale-support for pix_blur

2003-05-24 15:51  zmoelnig

	* since movement is stored in the Alpha-channel, i h?\008changed
	  processImage to processRGBA image.
	  
	  i have to think about how to store movement in other
	  colour-spaces.
	  grayscale: just in the image
	  yuv : ???

2003-05-23 08:13  cclepper

	* new integer processing mode - 4x faster than float

2003-05-22 07:33  cclepper

	* added Altivec

	* made CLAMP_TO_EDGE the repeat for TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT

2003-05-20 00:24  tigital

	* commented out call to pix_film_setup(): is this needed on any
	  platform (seems like we went thru this before)?...

2003-05-20 00:21  tigital

	* add #ifdef __APPLE__ to correctly include headers

2003-05-19 04:03  cclepper

	* now works on OSX

2003-05-19 03:50  cclepper

	* now works on OSX

2003-05-18 19:44  zmoelnig

	* we now have chY1,.... for YUV-offsets, i have used this now

2003-05-18 19:36  zmoelnig

	* added method for grey-images

2003-05-18 19:36  zmoelnig

	* bug-fix: there was weird-behaviour, when the offset was bigger
	  than the size of the cropped(!) image

2003-05-18 19:29  zmoelnig

	* "#elif def" doesn't compile under linux, but "#elif defined"
	  does...

2003-05-18 19:20  zmoelnig

	* updated

2003-05-18 09:13  cclepper

	* initial OSX version of mem2image()

	* added pix_rds_setup()

2003-05-17 20:20  tigital

	* cleanup a bit

2003-05-17 20:19  tigital

2003-05-17 18:47  tigital

	* correct casting in sprintf's to shutup compiler warning

2003-05-17 18:45  tigital

	* #elifdef doesn't compile on OSX, but #elif def does

2003-05-16 18:57  zmoelnig

	* moved BUGS to Gem/src (../)

2003-05-16 18:57  zmoelnig

	* file bugs under BUGS, and things that have to be done under TODO

2003-05-16 18:53  zmoelnig

	* added a BUGS file

2003-05-16 14:58  zmoelnig

	* #ifdef'ed everything with HAVE_DV (so it won't compile if there
	  are no libdv/dv.h headers)

2003-05-16 14:40  zmoelnig

	* fixed a typo that searched in "search_libs" instead of expanding
	  $search_libs

2003-05-16 14:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed a typo that searched for "searchlibs" instead of
	  "$searchlibs"

2003-05-16 12:36  zmoelnig

	* This commit was generated by cvs2svn to compensate for changes in
	  r380,
	  which included commits to RCS files with non-trunk default
	  branches.

2003-05-16 11:10  zmoelnig

	* commited result of merge

2003-05-16 11:07  zmoelnig

	* moved macors for image-processing from GemPixUtil to GemFuncUtil
	  (since they are functions, although they probably have not much
	  use for things other than PixProcessing (GemPixFun.h ?)

2003-05-16 10:53  zmoelnig

	* copied yuv_posterize to pix_posterize. YUV only. hope this works
	  as it should

2003-05-16 10:52  zmoelnig

	* switched back from PALETTE_YUV422 to PALETTE_YUV420P.
	  it seems as if video4linux means something different with YUV422
	  (or similar formats). too bad, conversions (copying!) again

2003-05-14 09:01  zmoelnig

	* ifdefed the use of GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE
	  obviously some other changes, which i hope do not break anything,
	  but i guess most of it is new indentation

2003-05-14 08:58  zmoelnig

	* removed tv_* help-patches, since they are not used any more

2003-05-14 08:03  zmoelnig

	* added data-acquisition "fromYUV422"
	  added offsets chY0, chY1, chU, chV for UYVY interleaved data
	  added a string2format converter (like 'rgba' to GL_RGBA), only
	  Grey, YUV, and RGBA are supported

2003-05-14 07:59  zmoelnig

	* added a topmostMess (a nop)

2003-05-14 07:58  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed the call for openGL-extension "rectangle-texture", since
	  there were problems when Gem was compiled without
	  rectangle-texture-support, but the drivers supported it (namely
	  nvidia-driver)

2003-05-14 07:50  zmoelnig

	* oops, missed one thing: when yuv was requested, we didn't
	  directly captured to yuv422 but rather to yuv420p. fixed

2003-05-14 07:48  zmoelnig

	* for testing i had hardcorded requests for some "wrong"
	  colour-spaces.
	  hopefully this is removed now

2003-05-14 07:46  zmoelnig

	* on platform that do not support yuv422-openGL-renderings (i
	  haven't managed to make my geforce behave the way i expected, and
	  of course there are other cards that will never support
	  yuv-textures), we now have implicit yuv2rgb-conversion

2003-05-14 07:44  zmoelnig

	* copy and pasted the yuv_emboss into the Pixes source.
	  for now, only yuv is supported

2003-05-14 07:44  zmoelnig

	* yet another colour-space converter ???
	  don't know whether this makes sense (remove it LATER)

2003-05-14 07:33  zmoelnig

	* added convert and emboss

2003-05-14 07:32  zmoelnig

	* added aliases for [pix_depot] and friends

2003-05-14 07:32  zmoelnig

	* [pix_put]: the frame# is now deleted after an image has been
	  written into the depot. the next incoming image will not be
	  stored until another frame# is given.

2003-05-13 02:06  tigital

	* added #define for logf(), expf(), sinf(), & cosf() on OS X (sin()
	  et. al. are already done w/double precision)

2003-05-13 02:00  tigital

	* added #define for sqrtf() on OS X

2003-05-13 01:59  tigital

	* reordered variables to reduce compiler warnings
	  added glext.h to compile on OS X

2003-05-13 00:54  cclepper

2003-05-12 09:37  cclepper

	* removed unused variable

	  that bad either)

2003-04-08 08:22  zmoelnig

	* the parent class for os/lib dependent video-grabbing (childs
	  include videoV4L, hopefully will include video1394, videoDS,

	* a threaded class for video capturing under linux

2003-04-06 19:23  zmoelnig

	  [pix_put] writes frames to [pix_depot] (like [tabwrite])

2003-04-01 05:25  tigital

	* OSX only: turns out that SampleNumToMediaTime() only worked when
	  1 movie was loaded...switched to a much simpler method of
	  calculating m_reqFrame's m_movieTime...which works with at least

2003-03-31 16:46  tigital

	* OSX only: forgot to set one flag correctly

2003-03-31 06:37  tigital

2003-02-24 11:45  zmoelnig

	* removed the default width/height from the constructor (this is
	  done in the cpp-file)

2003-02-24 11:40  zmoelnig

	* added a reallocate() message to imageStruct.
	  This does only allocate memory, if the previous buffer is smaller

2003-02-19 20:28  zmoelnig

	* updated the README.build (for the new configure)

2003-02-19 18:41  zmoelnig

2003-02-19 18:25  zmoelnig

	* GLdefines maps symbols (like GL_FLAT) to corresponding floats
	  (like 7424)

2003-02-10 00:14  tigital

	* changed gl setup calls to float (from integer): they should all
	  be one or the other, right?

2003-02-10 00:12  tigital

	* added setup for ripple, rubber, and slideSquares

2003-02-10 00:10  tigital

	* rubber: bang "grabs" image, x/y input the can pull/distort image,
	  2nd bang releases image, which rebounds back to flat

2003-02-10 00:08  tigital

	* slideSquare: creates a field of squares which reaveal texture
	  while moving left to right

2003-02-10 00:07  tigital

	* ripple: bang to inlet causes image rippling, center of ripple is
	  movable via x and y input: see example/07.texture/

2003-02-09 23:53  tigital

	* now has controls for size, speed, and mode; currently only works
	  with [pix_texture]; also requires rotateXYZ, scale, transposeXYZ
	  for centering (see example/texture)

	* removed HAVE_LIBGLUT for MACOSX

2003-02-05 08:55  cclepper

	  -ffast-math"

2003-02-04 00:16  zmoelnig

	* changed the behaviour of $(CXXFLAGS): you can now set CXXFLAGS
	  via the command-line and it it added to the c++-flags $(cxxflags)

2003-02-03 16:55  zmoelnig

	* changed the identifier for the list-ID from "list" to "gllist",
	  because pd would complain about this ("list" is reserved for
	  pd-lists)

2003-02-03 16:47  zmoelnig

	* added this README, so you know what the openGL-stuff is about...

2003-02-03 16:45  zmoelnig

	* *** empty log message ***

2003-02-03 16:42  zmoelnig

	* added the anything2grey converter

2003-02-03 16:40  zmoelnig

2003-02-03 16:40  zmoelnig

	* there are new ifdef's because of the new configure
	  spit out a warning when compiled without GLUT (is this new ?)

2003-02-03 16:37  zmoelnig

	* added an "m_modified" flag. this might double some code, but it
	  was surely quickto do

2003-02-03 16:34  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the configure-thing
	  hopefully it works now...

2003-02-03 16:32  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the configure-thing
	  hopefully it will work now...

2003-02-03 16:29  zmoelnig

2003-01-26 04:15  cclepper

	* fixed YUV code in pix_gain

2003-01-25 23:55  cclepper

2003-01-25 20:34  cclepper

	* test for yuv update

2003-01-13 14:50  tigital

2003-01-09 22:40  tigital

	* made s_windowClock=NULL on DestroyWindow to address possible
	  memory leak

2003-01-09 19:26  zmoelnig

	* *** empty log message ***

2003-01-09 19:25  zmoelnig

	* added movement_detection videoRTX

2003-01-07 18:59  zmoelnig

	* added some examples for 04.pix; they were missing?

2002-12-16 17:59  zmoelnig

	* yuv_*: (think) i changed these to the new process*Image()
	  functions

2002-12-16 17:54  zmoelnig

	* pix_info: get information on pixes (xsize, ysize, csize, format,
	  data)
	  pix_yuv : convert images to YUV (for now only RGBA); needs
	  testing
	  pix_rgba: provides a function for YUV; needs testing
	  * : new process*Image() functions for RGBA, YUV,...

2002-12-16 17:40  zmoelnig

	* teapot: if !HAVE_GLUT we still support [teapot], only the
	  rendering is void
	  text2d: the mac-#ifdefs didn't compile on linux, so i fixed them

2002-12-16 17:36  zmoelnig

	* GemPix*Obj: hopefully fixed the bug that appeared when deleting
	  pix_fx
	  now we cache the whole pixBuf-structure and return it on
	  postrendering
	  GemPixUtil: now provides a function for copying
	  imageStruct-information
	  GemGlutObj: if !HAVE_GLUT, we only throw an error at
	  object-creation

2002-12-14 04:43  tigital

2002-12-10 05:53  tigital

	* added MACOSX support

2002-12-09 11:36  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the <processImage>-callers.
	  processImage is now used for images of any(!) format.
	  thus the programmer has to care for the format him/herself
	  the format specific functions are processImageRGBA and similar
	  the same goes for PixDualObjects (processRGBA_Gray etc...)
	  deleted pix_fx
	  the pix_fx functionality is now in GemPixObj
	  this functionality is: save the image-state before it is
	  processed
	  and reconstruct it in the postrender function
	  so we can change size/format and even bend the data-pointer
	  and objects "before" will not notice (and crash)
	  revised 3 openGL objects (urgh: lots of work to do still)

2002-12-08 21:43  tigital

	* added support for MACOSX

	  ok: applied guenter's MMX changes to pix_*

2002-11-04 16:21  zmoelnig

	* applied guenter's MMX changes to some pix things (?)

2002-10-28 15:25  zmoelnig

	* - edited some example-patches (very minor changes)
	  - rewrote the render-chain mechanism: now the render-chain is not
	  built statically when the rendering is started
	  but dynamically (each gem.object is "banged" (with some gem_state
	  pointers) at run-time
	  gosh: why do we have a message-system in pd, if it is not used ?
