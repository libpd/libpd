GEM ONLINE DOCUMENTATION CHAPTER 7: TODO
----------------------------------------

  This is a list of future improvements and changes.
No importance should be given to the order...it is just
when I thought of things.
    - Mark D.
    - IOhannes m z

---------------------------- TODO -----------------------------

GENERAL
-------
only connect to tablet if gem_tablet exists
make a separate Gem-thread (to do parallel audio/video-processing)
enable output to other "devices": like files, video-editing-cards,...

PARTICLE
--------


OBJECTS
-------
triangle_fan
stereoscopic display with hardware glasses
NURBS/bezier patches
3DstudioMax file loader
CAL3d (character animation library): (not sure anymore. maybe quake2-files would be better ?)
Alias|Wavefront file data
    - articulation hierarchies in Wavefront's Kinemation
    - read Preview's .mov files (an ascii list of x, y, and/or z values)
morphing between alias|wavefront models
    - assume same number of points in each model

PIXES
-----
pix_dv (under linux this still needs a lot of testing)
motion and image analysis
some way to fragment an image so that it can be used as multiple
    texture maps (hopefully arbitrary shapes, but possibly only rectangular)
pix_erosion
pix_dilation
pix_median/min/max filter
pix_lowpass
pix_highpass
video external keyer
    - three inputs - the matte and two image inputs
increased control of the Threshold object.
    - upper and lower levels adjustable
stereoscopic texture loader
pix_circle
pix_triangle
test pix_video - espec offset message

OPENGL
------
be able to switch between single and double buffering on the fly
have multiple graphics windows
increased control of view port, etc.
be able to use multiple pipes (MCO)
try out glMatrixMode(GL_TEXTURE) to deal with nonstandard texture mapping
render to a pixblock (use pbuffers or offscreen renderer)
on systems that run in console mode only (like linux with(out) XFree86), render to the console with beautiful ASCII-art
multipass rendering
multitexturing
