<u>Using GEM with Pd</u></h2></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important fact is that GEM is NOT an application.
It is a library that the application Pd loads in at run-time.&nbsp; Most
of this information is taken directly from the GEM FAQ.

<h4>
<a NAME="GEMIrix"></a><u>How do I install GEM and Pd on IRIX?</u></h4>
See the readme for installing Pd.
<p>Uncompress and untar the GEM file that you downloaded.&nbsp; GEM should
be located at
<p>pd/gem
<p>depending on where you have installed Pd.
<p>If you run the shell script, GEM.INSTALL.sh, then all of the example
files and documention
<br>should be put in the correct locations.

<p>Unzip the GEM file that you downloaded so that it is at
<p>pd\gem
<p>depending on where you have installed Pd.
<p>If you run GEM.INSTALL.bat, then all of the example files and documentation
should be put in the correct locations.

<h4>
<a NAME="runIRIX"></a><u>How do I run GEM on IRIX?</u></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To use GEM type something like:
<p>/usr/people/mdanks/pd/bin/pd -lib /usr/people/mdanks/pd/gem/Gem
<p>(where /usr/people/mdanks is the path to the pd directory). Check out
the README for Pd to see examples of the -lib flag. If you just try to
"run" GEM, you will get an error! Notice that last word is a capital Gem.
If you get a "can't find gem_setup" error, then that is the problem. Look
in the GEM FAQ
<br>for trouble shooting suggestions.
<p>If you don't see startup messages from GEM, then something went wrong.
<br>Also, you might need to add pd/bin to your PATH environment variable.

<h4>
<a NAME="runWinNT"></a><u>How do I run GEM on Win95/NT?</u></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is best to start Pd from a DOS command line.&nbsp;
If you go to the Start menu, you should find an application called "Command
Prompt" under the Program menu.&nbsp; You need to change to the drive where
you installed Pd.&nbsp; For instance, if it is on your D: drive, just type
d: at the prompt.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To use GEM type something like:
<p>\pd\bin\pd -lib /pd/gem/Gem
<p>depending on where you installed Pd.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the README for Pd to see examples of the
-lib flag. If you just try to double click GEM, you will get an error!
Notice that last word is a capital Gem. If you get a "can't find gem_setup"
error, then that is the problem. Look in the GEM FAQ for trouble shooting
suggestions.
<p>If you don't see a startup message from GEM, then something went wrong.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people use the command shell to start Pd.&nbsp;
It is difficult to configure Pd to run from double-clicking on the icon.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you might need to add pd/bin to your PATH environment
variable.

<h4>
<a NAME="runIRIX"></a><u>How do I run GEM on linux?</u></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To use GEM type something like:

<p>(where /usr/people/mdanks is the path to the pd directory). Check out

<h4>
<a NAME="runIRIX"></a><u>How do I run GEM on macOS-X?</u></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To use GEM type something like:
<code>/usr/local/bin/pd -lib /Users/zmoelnig/pd/Gem</code>
<p>(where /usr/local/bin/pd is the path to the pd directory and 
/Users/zmoelnig/pd is the path where the <i>Gem.pd_darwin</i> resides). 
Check out the README for Pd to see examples of the -lib flag. If you just try to
"run" GEM, you will get an error! Notice that last word is a capital Gem.
If you get a "can't find gem_setup" error, then that is the problem. Look

<h4>
<a NAME="noRun"></a><u>Why doesn't GEM run?</u></h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that the -lib flag always requires Unix styles
slashes, even if you are on Windows.&nbsp; This means that you need to
do <i>-lib /gem/Gem</i>, not <i>-lib \gem\Gem</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also want to use the -nosound flag.&nbsp;
For instance, my PC has problems using audio (it leaks memory), so I just
turn off the audio part of Pd.&nbsp; However, other people can't get GEM
to work if the -nosound is used (on Win95).&nbsp; You can also try the
-dac or -adc flags (for digital-analog-conversion only and analog-digital-conversion
only).
