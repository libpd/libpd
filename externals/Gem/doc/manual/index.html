<p>This is the first attempt at a manual for GEM, so bear with me.
Any comments are appreciated. Send them to <a href="mailto:mark@danks.org">Mark Danks</a>
<hr>
In fact, this ought to be the second attempt at such a manual. There will not be much now.
But send any comments to <a href="mailto:zmoelnig@iem.kug.ac.at">IOhannes m zm&ouml;lnig</a> instead.
