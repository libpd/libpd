GEM ONLINE DOCUMENTATION CHAPTER 4: Known bugs
----------------------------------------------

---------------------------- KNOWN BUGS -----------------------------

[pix_lumaoffset] crashes
--------------
POSTED 15/05/04
--------------
BUG: pix_lumaoffset crashes when the offset-factor is very high and fill+smooth is turned on
ANS: yes; but we haven't found where the bug is hidden yet

loading movies leaks memory under Win32
--------------
POSTED 4/16/02
--------------
BUG: each time an AVI is loaded, the used memory increases for about 400k.
     after some time (and opening MANY files) this will be too much...
ANS: i fear, this is really a mikro$oft bug! (probably not;-))


loading MPEG-movies crashes under Win32
--------------
POSTED 4/05/04
--------------
BUG: loading MPEG-movies (*.MPG) crashes pd
ANS: MPEG is not really supported under the Win32-version of Gem
     however Gem tries to decode MPEGs via QuickTime which might crash (see below)

loading AVI-movies does not work under Win32
--------------
POSTED 4/05/04
--------------
BUG: loading some AVI-movies with certain codecs does not work under Win2k and bigger.
ANS: Gem is (still) using a rather old API for decoding videos. 
     it might well be, that not all installed codecs are supported (e.g. Indeo-5)


have to destroy / create window to change lighting state in buffer == 1
--------------
POSTED 11/07/98
--------------
BUG: If you want to change the lighting when GEM is running in single
     buffer mode, you have to destroy and then create the window.
ANS: hopefully we will drop single-buffer mode soon (enabling double-buffer feedback instead) (2004)


WinNT pix_video object
--------------
POSTED 6/25/98
-------------
BUG: The WinNT pix_video object has a lot of problems.  It is not
     very stable, tends to lock up the machine, etc.
ANS: don't have much problems with it.
     daniel's directshow-support enables support for most newer (ieee1394,usb) cameras under win,
     although the interface is somewhat different than on other OS's
     (eg: set dimensions via pop-up menu,...)


splines are incorrect
--------------
POSTED 6/25/98
--------------
BUG: In preventing the crasher in the spline object, I have introduced
     another bug.  Mainly, the end points don't get computed correctly.


Polygon doesn't tesselate (ie, polygons sometimes look strange)
--------------
POSTED 5/19/97
--------------
BUG: Because the polygon object doesn't tesselate itself,
     if it is concave, the behavior is undefined under OpenGL.


glxContext memory leak
--------------
POSTED 5/18/97
--------------
BUG: The dummy glxContext doesn't ever get destroyed.  Use a static object
     to create and destroy it when the DSO is loaded/unloaded.


Indycam broken
--------------
POSTED 5/1/97
--------------
BUG: The Indycam object doesn't seem to work.  While getting the O2cam
     up, I seem to have broken the Indycam object.  One known
     bug is that the Indycam doesn't accept the dimen message.
ANS: i don't have a running SGI with an indycam at hand, so i
     don't know how to fix it

---------------------------- FIXED BUGS -----------------------------

some geos don't render data from pix_movie correctly
--------------
POSTED 19/03/2004
FIXED  20/03/2004
--------------
BUG: Some objects don't render images correctly
ANS: Gem tries to use rectangle-textures when available
     GLU-objects cannot handle such textures
FIX: send a "mode 0" message to the [pix_texture]
FIX2:put the specific GLU-code into Gem and fixed the problem


some geos don't render data from pix_movie correctly
--------------
POSTED 4/24/99
FIXED  20/03/2004
--------------
BUG: Sphere and cone don't texture map movie data correctly because
     they ignore the texture coordinates that pix_movie sets.
ANS: as long as we use the libGLU for these objects there is not much chance
     to fix the core of this problem
FIX: put the specific GLU-code into Gem and fixed the problem


Cone and sphere ignore textCoords
--------------
POSTED 4/12/99
FIXED  20/03/2004
--------------
BUG: The glu library is used to create the cone and sphere, so gem
     doesn't control the texture coordinates used.
FIX: put the specific GLU-code into Gem and fixed the problem


text2d is messed up
--------------
FIXED 01/01/04
POSTED 2/22/98
--------------
BUG: text2d doesn't really work at all.  There seems to be a bug
     in the GLTT library which is messing up the rasterpos.
FIX: use FTGL rather than GLTT


curve is broken under Linux
--------------
FIXED  01/01/04
POSTED 0/24/99
--------------
BUG: if curve is used under Linux, it core dumps when rendering.
     It dumps on glMap1f(GL_MAP1_VERTEX_3, 0.0, 1.0, 3, m_numInputs, &(m_vert[0][0]));
ANS: seems to work now


model crashes when nothing is loaded
---------------
FIXED  01/01/04
POSTED 10/25/02
---------------
BUG: if rendering is started without a model being loaded before, pd crashes
ANS: seems to be fixed sime time ago...


pix_imageInPlace crashes when nothing is loaded
---------------
FIXED  01/01/04
POSTED 10/25/02
---------------
BUG: when trying to download non-existant images (by specifying the wrong
     preload-name), pd-crashes
ANS: seems to be fixed now...


Can't process pix_movie data with pix objects
--------------
FIXED 4/15/02
POSTED 4/24/99
--------------
BUG: pix_movie sends the data immediately to OpenGL,
     so there is no chance to process the data.
ANS: it does what it does; [pix_film] does not send the image-data immediately, so use it instead


pix_2grey doesn't process the correct number of pixels
--------------
FIXED 2/19/00
POSTED 2/18/00
--------------
BUG: The pixel count is calculated with addition instead of multiplying.
ANS: Just changed how the calculation occurs.


tablet not reset on exit
--------------
FIXED 1/24/99
POSTED 8/29/98
--------------
BUG: If the user has a tablet, it is not reset to the default settings
     on exit, making it unusable as a mouse.
ANS: Just needed to do some more cleanup on exit.  Should be okay now.


text object can't be found
--------------
FIXED 2/21/98
POSTED 5/1/97
--------------
BUG: Because the text is a special keyword and object inside of
     pd, the text object cannot be found as a GEM object.  The solution
     is to rename it to something else.
ANS: I am using a cool library called gltt which will render true type
     fonts in OpenGL.


Memory exception on WinNT
--------------
FIXED 12/15/97
POSTED 11/30/97
--------------
BUG: If you use pix_image, then there is a memory exception (ie, crash) when
     you exit Pd.  It doesn't happen while actually running Pd/GEM.
ANS: Mysterious...it went away.


Polygon and curve under NT
--------------
FIXED 10/21/97
POSTED 10/21/97
--------------
BUG: The vertex calls are receiving 0, 0, 0 for x, y, z
ANS: Extra type * parameter in the vert_* calls


Single buffering under NT
--------------
FIXED 10/21/97
POSTED 10/19/97
--------------
BUG: Single buffering doesn't work under NT.
ANS: Need an explicit glFlush().  gemHead calls glFlush after a bang message.


Geos texture coordinates
--------------
FIXED 10/17/97
POSTED 6/16/97
--------------
BUG: The vertex and texture coordinates should start so that the first
     S,T is 0,0
ANS: Just did it.


pix_composite is backwards
--------------
FIXED  7/12/97
POSTED 6/16/97
--------------
BUG: The pix_composite object should have its inlets swapped.  Conceptually
     it doesn't make sense the way it works currently.
FIX: Just did it.


pix_convolve is broken
--------------
FIXED  7/13/97
POSTED 6/16/97
--------------
BUG: Sometimes pix_convolve doesn't work - seems to do with the scale factor
ANS: I'm not sure why it wasn't working.  I have hammered it with a variey
     of kernels and scales and never had a problem...
ANS2: I found a bug where pix_image didn't automatically refresh its image
      at the start of rendering


pix_alpha is backwards
--------------
FIXED  7/12/92
POSTED 6/16/97
--------------
BUG: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
ANS: Swapped around the inlet creations


polygon's first inlet doesn't work
--------------
FIXED  5/18/97
POSTED 5/17/97
--------------
BUG: The first vertex of polygon doesn't work.  It is always set to the
     origin.  Also, polygon defaults to line drawing.  Check Curve for
     the same problems (it is derived from polygon).
ANS: The first inlet no longer takes the first vertex.  I added another
     inlet.


fonts do not load
--------------
FIXED  4/02/02
POSTED 4/01/02
--------------
BUG: the example fonts for text2d/text3d do not load
FIX: accidentally i did a dos2unix to the *.ttf files. this damaged them.
     Get new ones from ftp://iem.at/pd/Externals/GEM/misc
