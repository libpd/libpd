In order to compile the stk external you have to put the latest
stk release (4.2.0) in this directory.

* First compile stk

if stk is compiled just do a make stk.pd_linux.


Hint:
You may have to set the rawwaves path in stk in so that the external
can find them.  See the STK INSTALL file for details.
You do not have to specify a special audio API, as audio I/O is done
through pd.

The stk configure command should be something like this:

./configure RAWWAVE_PATH="/home/gary/rawwaves/"
