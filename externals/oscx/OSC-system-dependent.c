/* OSC-system-dependent.c

   Matt Wright, 3/13/98

   File of procedures OSC has to call that are not part of the OSC package
   and that you, the developer adding OSC addressability to an application,
   must write in a way that makes sense in the context of your system.

   You should also look at OSC-timetag.c and see if there's a better way
   to handle time tags on your system.

/* Printing stuff: for now, use stderr.  Some cleverer stuff we could do:

    - Make a silent mode where these don't do anything.
    - Return error messages via OSC to some client
