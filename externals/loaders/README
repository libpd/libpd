This package provides support for the loading objectclasses with special characters
It should work with any version of Pd 0.40 or newer.

To install, copy the files for your platform into your "extra" folder and the
help patches to the "doc/5.reference" folder.  You will need to load the
hexloader.dll/hexloader.pd_linux/hexloader.pd_darwin as a library before trying to load
any objects with special characters

You can add a library in several ways:
 - add this text to one of the fields in the "Startup" prefs:  hexloader
 - load it on the command line with this:  -lib hexloader
 - create an object [declare -lib hexloader] in your main patch
 - create an object [hexloader]

If you want to compile these yourself, changedir into ./hexloader and run "make"

for more information see the README.txt in the hexloader/ folder
