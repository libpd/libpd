= things you might ask yourself frequently =
============================================

Q: what's this?
A: please read the README.txt for an explanation

Q: it doesn't work!
A: try increasing the verbosity of Pd by adding the "-verbose" flag 
   _multiple times_ to the startup flags; [hexloader] will become more
   talkative at verbosity-level 2, which will help you (or us) to find the 
   source of your problem

Q: hexloading abstraction does not work
A1: it is not enabled by default! you can enable it by setting the 
    HEXLOADER_PATCHES preprocessor-define either via the Makefile or within
    the source file.
    the reason why it is disabled is:
A2: hexloading abstractions (as opposed to "externals" written in other 
    languages (anything that uses the loader-mechanism; e.g. C or lua or python
    externals; but not Pd-abstractions)) is currently broken as it does not 
    correctly resolve abstractions embedded within hexloaded abstractions.
    that's a problem of Pd's abstraction-loading mechanism which i would rather
    solve on the Pd-side
