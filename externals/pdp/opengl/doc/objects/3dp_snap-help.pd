#X text 38 16 couping 3dp and pdp can be done using 3dp_snap and pdp_convert.
the correct way to do it is to put 3dp_snap in a rendering chain and
give it arguments like this: [3dp_snap image/*/* 320 240] if you specify
the subtype to be image/multi/* \, the packet will not be colour space
converted: it will stay rgb. if you want to make a snapshot to store
as a high quality png image \, snap to bitmap/rgb/* and store it in
pdp_reg to save. to convert an image back to a texture \, use [pdp_convert
texture/*/*] if you snap to a texture (which is the default) the dimensions
don't need to be specified. a texture will be allocated that can contain
the entire screen. this is because texture coordinates are relative
and data is always interpolated. snapping only works correctly when
the window is not covered by other windows.;
