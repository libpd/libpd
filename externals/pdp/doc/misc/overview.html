<h1>Pure Data Packet</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Pure Data Packet (PDP) is an extension library for the computer music 
program <a href="http://www.puredata.info">Pure Data</a> (PD), by <a href = 
"http://www-crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html">Miller Puckette</a> and 
others. Its goal is to provide a way to use arbitrary data types (data 
packets) as messages that can be passed around inside PD, along side the 
standard PD numbers and symbol types. In short it puts any data object on 
the same level as a float or a symbol.

<p>PDP runs on Linux and OSX. The OSX version depends on <a 
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>. There is no 
windows version.

<p> Currently, PDP's focus is on images and video, but there is no reason it 
should stay like that. There is limited support for matrix processing 
included in the main library (like Jitter or Gridflow). There is an 
extension library for 1D and 2D binary cellular automata, opengl rendering 
(like Gem). Some plans include audio buffers (like Vasp), ascii packets, 
text buffers, ... Finally there's a library that enables you to connect a 
scheme interpreter (guile) to PD/PDP. For more image processing objects,
have a look at Yves Degoyon's <a 
href="http://ydegoyon.free.fr/pidip.html">PiDiP</a> library.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

If you're used to working with PD, the the documentation and example 
patches should be enough to get you started. Have a look at the README file 
in the distribution to find out how to compile and setup. The file 
<code>doc/reference.txt</code> contains a list of objects. If you have installed PDP 
properly, you can just press the right mouse button on an object and select 
help to get a help patch. If this doesn't work, look in the directory 
<code>doc/objects</code> for a collection of help patches. The directory <code>doc/examples</code>
contains some more demos. The directory <code>doc/objects</code> contains two 
abstractions that are used to setup the input and output in the help 
patches. You might want to cut and connect some wires to use the 
input/output setup that works for you.

<h2>Packets and Types</h2>

<p> PDP is about packets and operations on packets. Packets are just chunks
of dumb data. The interpretation of this data depends on its type name.
There are several types of packets. The default type for most 
objects is <code><b>image/YCrCb/320x240</b></code>. This is a single video 
frame, encoded in the internal 16bit YUV format, measuring 320 by 240 
pixels. Another image type is the grayscale image 
<code><b>image/grey/320x240</b></code>. Important notes: All image processing objects that
combine two or more packets need to be fed with the same packet types, i.e.
encoding (YCrCb/grey) and dimensions need to be the same. Image dimensions need to be a 
multiple of <code><b>8x8</b></code>.

<p> The 
<code><b>bitmap/*/*</b></code> type is another image representation type 
supporting several encodings. I.e. <code><b>bitmap/rgb/*</b></code>,  
<code><b>bitmap/rgba/*</b></code>, <code><b>bitmap/yv12/*</b></code>, ...

This type cannot be processed directly by most of the image processing 
objects, but it can be used to store in delay lines, or to send over the 
network. It's main use is to support all kinds of input/output devices, and 
opengl textures, without introducing too many conversions, but it can serve 
as a space and bandwidth saver too (especially 
<code><b>bitmap/yv12/*</b></code>).

<p> One of the interesting
features in PD is the possibility of connecting everything with everything. 
If you want to generalize this to all kinds of media objects, the complexity 
of managing the different types starts to grow quite fast. Therefore PDP has 
a type conversion system that can take care of most of the conversions 
using the <code><b>[pdp_convert]</b></code> object. You can manually convert 
packets to a certain type by specifying a type template as a creation 
argument. I.e. <code><b>[pdp_convert image/grey/*]</b></code> will convert 
any packet to a greyscale image. Most of the conversion will become 
automatic later on.

<p> An example: You can use the basic PDP library together with the 
cellular automata library and the opengl rendering library to use a cellular 
automaton as an input to a video processing chain. You can convert the 
processed image to a texture that can be applied to a 3d object, which then 
can be drawn to the screen, captured as a texture, converted back to an 
image, which can then be converted to a sound, processed and converted back 
to an image,  etc... You get the point. The possibilities are endless.

<p> Over the last couple of years, PDP has given birth to a forked off project called
<a href="http://zwizwa.goto10.org/zwikizwaki.php?page=PacketForth">Packet Forth</a>.
This is a programming laguage based on ideas from Forth and Lisp. It's aim is
loosely to be a kind of 'media Perl'.
