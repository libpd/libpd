This is `old' pdp. Adapted from the version 0.12.4 released on 09-Jul-2004. 

As you might know, i started working on Packet Forth about two years
ago. This has shifted my opinion as to what PDP should be quite a bit.
In order not to annoy people using the old PDP with my new and exciting
insights about forth, I declare this version to be the `stable' PDP 12.
The DEC PDP 13 never existed, so this might have been a sign...

For people interested in packet forth, check http://zwizwa.be/packetforth
for more information. Stable PDP might include some additions from PF
later on, but main focus right now is stability.

Groet,
Tom
