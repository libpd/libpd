first, install pdp and gem sources
( it has been tested successfully with gem-0.87
pdp-0.9.0 and pidip-0.9.1 )

Use the configure script and specify the directories:
e.g.: ./configure --with-pddir=../../pd --with-gemdir=../../gem/Gem --with-pdpdir=../pdp

make clean 

make

gem2pdp requires the loading of gem and pdp libraries, of course.

Enjoy!!

Thanx for getting here.
