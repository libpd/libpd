#X text 62 225 ** - The pseudo-code must not have any spaces. Each
line in the pseudo-code is considered to be a single "assignment" statement.
There is no need to worry about creating storage for any intermediate
(calculated) variables \, as that is done by the translation program.
The pseudo-code represents variables and parameters with a '$' before
the variable name. Locals are allowed \, but are preceded with a '#'.
(Locals are used as 'intermediate' \, computed values that are not
retained from iteration to iteration.);
