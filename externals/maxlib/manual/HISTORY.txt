  instead of clock to poll for incoming data, circular recv buffer

v 1.5 (18. october 2003):
- added some usefull features to arraycopy (i.e. copying just parts of
  an array and copying to specified position in destination array)

- new object: arraycopy

v 1.3 (12. april 2003):
- new objects: sync listfifo

- new objects: unroute urn split wrap rewrap timebang
- another fix for the makefile

- arbran 0.1b now allows to (re-)set the arrays dynamically
- match 0.3 now matches any type of data (floats, lists, symbols, anything)
- scale 0.2 allows to dynamically change the creation arguments and to choose
  between linear (default) and exponential scale
- MSVC++ workspace contains configuration for Intel Compiler with Pentium 4 
  optimizations ("maxlib - Win32 Intel")
- makefile and binary release for Mac OS X (10.1.5)
- BUG FIX: corrected path to helpfiles in rand objects
- BUG FIX: corrected makefile to work under Linux again
