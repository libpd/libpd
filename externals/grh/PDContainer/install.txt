PDContainer installation:


1) open the right makefile for your platform/compiler

2) adapt the makefile for your needs:
     PD-PATH should point to your pd installation (usually /usr/local/lib/pd or /usr/lib/pd)
     PD-SCR should point to the PD source diretory

3) type "make" to compile
(or the equicalent command with other compilers than gcc, e.g. nmake with msvc)

4) type "make install" to install help patches and binary
(you have to be root probably)
