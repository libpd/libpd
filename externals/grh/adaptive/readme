adaptive is a PD-external library for adaptive systems and filters.

An adaptive system tries to learn from signals of the past. Mostly it is a simple FIR filter, whoes coefficients can be learned to model or predict an other system.
Some applications: system identification, echo cancelation, linear prediction, interference cancelation, self-tuning control, ...

For a lecture at the TU-Graz we implemented various versions of the LMS and NLMS algorithm (= least mean square and normalized least mean square adaptation algorithm).
We also added a lot of examples (see PD-patches in example folder): system identification, interference cancelation, adaptive equalization, decision-directed equalization, ...

A RLS (recursive least square) algorithm and more example patches (e.g. echo cancelation, ...) will follow when I have to learn for the exam ...

For more documentation look through the help and example patches!
