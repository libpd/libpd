#X text 22 46 capture~ is similar to the capture object \, except that
it collects signal values rather than incoming integers. capture~ is
designed for signal debugging or investigation321for recording \, use
record~ or sfrecord~;
#X text 326 139 Write as text file;
#X text 160 207 Arguments: - optional "f" or "first" to put capture~
into "first" mode where it stops collecting data after it has received
the specified number of values \; - number of values to capture \;
- the print precision (number of decimal places shown) \; - a list
of up to 10 indices within a signal vector. If no indices present \,
capture~ records the entire vector.;
#X text 160 301 Default values: - "last" mode \, where capture~ continues
to collect data \, throwing away old values if it has received more
than its specified number \; - 4100 values \; - print precision of
4 decimal places \; - record the entire signal vector \;;
#X text 30 107 (look at values from a sine wave...);
#X text 43 387 Note that capture~'s text window only holds a limited
amount of data \, so it's easy to capture more data than you can see.
If you want to see all the data \, write it to a text file and open
the file with another text editor.;
