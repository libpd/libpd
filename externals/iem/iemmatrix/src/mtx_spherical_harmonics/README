This directory contains the "sphbase" library C-files implementing the Legendre-polynomials, spherical harmonics, normalization constants, spherical Hankel and Bessel functions. The rotation/translation operations are currently not implemented and will be added soon.

The C-code is published under the Gnu General Public License.

To make the c-sources, use:

<sphbase-path>/c_src$ make 

You will get some test routines (legendre_a, sh_normalization, sh) and the library file (sh.o).

To test the functions, use e.g.
./legendre_a 3
./sh_normalization 3
./sh 3 1 0.5 0.5

The radial functions are currently not part of the Makefile. The near-field approximation for the spherical Bessel function hasn't been added yet.
