Installation/Compilation instructions for "iemmatrix"
=====================================================


1) linux (and other autoconf-systems):
======================================
	"cd" into iemmatrix/src/
	run "aclocal"
	run "autoconf"
	run "./configure" (see "./configure --help" for valid options)
	run "make"
	run "make install"
	enjoy.

	this should install iemmatrix into /usr/local/lib/pd (unless you specify otherwise)
	the dynamic-lib (iemmatrix.pd_linux) is installed into extra/
	the configure-script tries to detect whether you are running a pd>=0.37; if so, the 
	help-patches are installed into extra/iemmatrix; if you are running an old version
	of pd, the help-files will be installed into doc/5.reference/iemmatrix

	
2) mac OS-X:
============
	there is nothing special in the code, so it should compile out of the box:
	"cd" to iemmatrix/src
	run "./bootstrap.sh; ./configure; make" (for further details please see "1) linux")
	building with a special version of Pd:
		to build iemmatrix with your special version of Pd, you should specify the path to your Pd ressources
		(e.g. "./configure --with-pd=/Applications/Pd.app/Contents/Resources")
	fat-binaries
		if you want to build a multi-arch binary you have to specify this as well
		(e.g. "./configure --enable-fat-binary=i386,ppc --with-extension=d_fat")

3) irix:
========
	i don't have any irix machine at hand, so i don't know whether it works
	but again, since iemmatrix does not use anything special, it should work out of the box
	try using configure in iemmatrix/src
	(for further details please see "1) linux")

4) W32:
=======
	with MinGW installed, you probably might be able to use the configure in iemmatrix/src
	users have reported that they were able to build it (with problems)
	http://lists.puredata.info/pipermail/pd-list/2005-05/028266.html
	i will support a makefile for msvc as soon as i boot into windows again

CrossCompilation for w32 with MinGW (http://www.mingw.org) on linux-systems
	you need a cross-compilation tool-chain for windows (there is a debian-package mingw32)
	run "./configure" and specify the path to your windows installation of pd
	the simplest way is to give the PDPATH via the "--with-pd=PDPATH" flag; you have to make 
	sure that the pd-sources are in PDPATH/src and the compiled pd-binaries in PDPATH/bin
	if those are scattered across you filesystem you can alternatively give explicitely the paths
	to your "m_pd.h" (with --includedir) and to your "pd.lib" (with --libdir)
	don't forget to override the default extension ("pd_linux" on linux-systems) with the more appropriate "dll".
	on bash this looks like:
	 % ./configure --disable-PIC --with-extension=dll --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-pd=/path/to/w32-pd/
	now run "make" and enjoy.
	


5) FreeBSD et al:
=================
	i don't know, but why it shouldn't run there ?
	try the configure in iemmatrix/src (see 1)linux for more information)
	and report any success or failure
