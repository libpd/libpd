scratchpad for the development of iemnet
========================================

speed & syslocks
================
one bottleneck right now is the synchronisation with Pd's
main thread to register a clock callback.
doing a sys_lock() whenever a package arrives will slow down things immensely.

alternatives:
 no sys_lock(): will eventually crash Pd (no option)
 use sys_trylock(): this might eventually fail to notify Pd of newly arrived
                    packets (bad for throughput)
 external polling: no syslock needed at all, but more complicated
 keep track of clock_callback: "notified" flag tells us, whether we have already
           sent a notification which has not yet been handled...no need to notify again

 #4 looks most promising


tests for tcpclient/server:
	client disconnects -> server should get notified
	server disconnects -> client should get notified
	client crashes -> server should disconnect
	server crashes -> client should disconnect
