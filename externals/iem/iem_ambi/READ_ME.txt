This library extends the performance of miller puckette's pure data (pd).

iem_ambi is written by Thomas Musil from IEM Graz Austria
 and it is compatible to miller puckette's pd-0.37-3 to pd-0.39-2.
see also LICENCE.txt, GnuGPL.txt.

iem_ambi contains 3 objects: 
"ambi_encode", "ambi_rot" and "ambi_decode3" 
they calculate ambisonic encoder matrices, rotation matrices and
decoder matrices from 1st to 4th order in 3D, or from 1st to 12th order in 2D.
ambisonic is a 3D sound spatialisation system with separated encoding and decoding.
(calculation base are the spherical harmonics).
