0.11.0: 2018 Sep

* updated to pd vanilla 0.48-2
* the libpd C core is now thread safe
* support for multiple libpd instances is more or less working, see new
  libpd_*_instance() api and pdtest_multi/pdtest_thread C samples,
  note: language wrappers are not yet updated with the new APIs
* libpd can now open a patch in the Pd vanilla GUI directly, see the new
  libpd_startgui()/libpd_stopgui() functions and the pdtest_gui C sample
* enable/query verbose printing with new libpd_set_verbose()/libpd_get_verbose()
  functions (Pierre Guillot)

  this also fixes iOS build error due to system calls being removed in Xcode 9
* libpd binaries built with MinGW now work in Visual Studio (see readme)
* updated ringbuffer atomics macros to use C11 stdatomics.h if available,
  this fixes deprecation warning on macOS 10.12

* fixed bug in libpd_sysex which masked 8 bit bytes, the MIDI spec allows 8 bit
  bytes except for realtime messages

       makes it possible to use libpd compiled by MinGW & C++ with Visual Studio
