# C++ RtAudio Example.

This is a basic C++ sample application that uses the RtAudio library for audio output.

It has been tested on Linux with ALSA and JACK & macOS with CoreAudio. In other systems, you'll have
to add preprocessor defines such as __MACOSX_CORE__ in the Makefile. See the RtAudio documentation for details.
