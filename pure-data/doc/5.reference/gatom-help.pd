#X text 84 40 Number boxes allow you to display numbers or to enter
numbers using the mouse and keyboard. When a number arrives at the
number box's inlet \, it is displayed and sent to the outlet. You can
click on a number box and drag upward or downward to change the value
continuously.;
#X text 88 130 You can shift-click and drag to change the number by
hundredths instead of units. Alt clicking toggles the value between
0 and the last nonzero value.;
#X text 83 184 You can also type in values by clicking and typing a
number followed by "enter.";
#X text 30 220 the "set" message sets the number box's value but does
not send it to the outlet.;
#X text 423 482 updated for Pd version 0.34;
#X text 39 339 You can set the width of the box by right-clicking and
choosing "properties." By default the width is 5 characters. If you
select a width of 0 \, the number box will grow as needed to hold the
number--BUT BEWARE \, THIS IS EXPENSIVE IN CPU TIME. In a production
patch \, you'll want to set a specific width.;
