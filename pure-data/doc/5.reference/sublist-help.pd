#X obj 21 10 sublist;
#X text 86 10 -- get a list from a field of a scalar;
#X text 31 37 Don't try this yet -- it's untested.;
#X text 36 89 "sublist" will take as creation arguments a template
name and a field name \; its one input takes a pointer. If you send
a pointer (which should agree with the template name) \, "sublist"
will output the field (which should be of type "list".) The output
is in fact a pointer to the head of the sublist.;
