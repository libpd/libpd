object. Any subwindows of this window can also be switched off here.
If a patch and a superpatch both have switches \, both must be "on"
for DSP to run in the patch.;

If you supply arguments to switch \, the patch will be switched AND
reblocked.;

64 If you want to reblock audio computation \, do so in a sub-patch
and keep the adc~ and dac~ objects in a super-patch. Also \, you can't
send~ or receive~ between windows with different block sizes or overlapping.
Only the inlet~ and outlet~ objects know how to reblock signals. In

in the switched subwindow \, but not the blocked one.;
