#X text 32 195 Audio computation can be turned on and off by sending
messages to the global "pd" object as follows:;
#X msg 98 239 \; pd dsp 1;
#X msg 202 239 \; pd dsp 0;
#X text 113 276 ON;
#X text 222 276 OFF;
#X text 29 297 You should see the Pd window change to reflect whether
audio is on or off. You can also turn audio on and off using the "audio"
menu \, but the buttons are provided as a shortcut.;
#X text 30 368 When DSP is on \, you should hear a tone whose pitch
is A 440 and whose amplitude is 0.05. If instead you are greeted with
silence \, you might want to read the HTML documentation on setting
up audio.;
#X text 28 434 In general when you start a work session with Pd \,
you will want to choose "test audio and MIDI" from the help window
\, which opens a more comprehensive test patch than this one.;
#X text 296 247 <-- click these;
#X text 187 139 <-- reduce amplitude to 0.05;
#X text 160 168 <----- send to the audio output device;
#X text 32 23 Audio computation in Pd is done using "tilde objects"
such as the three below. They use continuous audio streams to intercommunicate
\, as well as communicating with other ("control") Pd objects using
messages.;
