This is the second of three tutorial series on Pd.  This one shows the
time-domain audio processing features.  (The first one showed how to use Pd to
do "control" computations, and the third is about frequency-domain techniques.)

These patches are accompanied by an ONLINE BOOK:

which develops the underlying theory.
