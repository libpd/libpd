#X text 35 28 You can use "qlist" or "textfile" objects for sequencing.
Qlist is simpler to use than the (more versatile) textfile.;
#X obj 345 144 r receive1;
#X obj 441 146 r receive2;
#X msg 205 88 clear \, add receive1 1 \, add 1000 receive1 0 \, add
receive2 2 \, add 1000 receive2 0 \, add receive1 3 \, bang;
#X obj 205 129 qlist;
#X floatatom 345 170 0 0 0 0 - - -;
#X floatatom 441 171 0 0 0 0 - - -;
#X text 48 202 The "add" messages add lines to the qlist \, so that
it contains:;
#X text 155 238 receive1 1;
#X text 154 259 1000 receive1 0;
#X text 155 279 receive2 2;
#X text 153 299 1000 receive2 0;
#X text 155 317 receive1 3;
#X text 16 391 If you have more than 5 lines or so wou will probably
want to store them as a separate file and have qlist read it. You can
also write files \, set tempo \, and single step... see the help patch
for details.;
#X text 22 341 and the "bang" instructs qlist to play the sequence
by sending messages to "receive" objects. Messages starting with numbers
request that amount of delay.;
