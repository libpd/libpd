	/// <summary>
	/// LibPD provides basic C# bindings for pd. It follows the libpd Java bingings as good as possible.
	/// 
	/// Some random notes from Peter Brinkmann on the java bindings:
	/// 
	/// - This is a low-level library that aims to leave most design decisions to
	/// higher-level code. In particular, it will throw no exceptions (except for the
	/// methods for opening files, which may throw an <seealso cref="IOException"/> when appropriate). 
	/// At the same time, it is designed to be
	/// fairly robust in that it is thread-safe and does as much error checking as I
	/// find reasonable at this level. Client code is still responsible for proper
	/// dimensioning of buffers and such, though.
	/// 
	/// - The MIDI methods choose sanity over consistency with pd or the MIDI
	/// standard. To wit, channel numbers always start at 0, and pitch bend values
	/// are centered at 0, i.e., they range from -8192 to 8191.
	/// 
	/// - The basic idea is to turn pd into a library that essentially offers a
	/// rendering callback (process) mimicking the design of JACK, the JACK Audio
	/// Connection Kit.
	/// 
	/// - The release method is mostly there as a reminder that some sort of cleanup
	/// might be necessary; for the time being, it only releases the resources held
	/// by the print handler, closes all patches, and cancels all subscriptions.
	/// Shutting down pd itself wouldn't make sense because it might be needed in the
	/// future, at which point the native library may not be reloaded.
	/// 
	///  - I'm a little fuzzy on how/when to use sys_lock, sys_unlock, etc., and so I
	/// decided to handle all synchronization on the Java side. It appears that
	/// sys_lock is for top-level locking in scheduling routines only, and so
	/// Java-side sync conveys the same benefits without the risk of deadlocks.
	///
